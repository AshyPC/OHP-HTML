<h3>O Worship The King, All Glorious Above</h3>
1. O worship the King all glorious above,
and gratefully sing His power and His love;
our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise.
</section>
<section>
2. O tell of His might and sing of His grace,
whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
</section>
<section>
3. The earth, with its store of wonders untold,
Almighty, Your power has founded of old;
established it fast by Your changeless decree,
and round it has cast like a mantle the sea.
</section>
<section>
4. Your bountiful care what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.
</section>
<section>
5. We children of dust are feeble and frail:
in You we will trust, for You never fail;
Your mercies are tender, and firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.
</section>
<section>
6. O measureless Might, unchangeable Love,
whom angels delight to worship above!
Your ransomed creation with glory ablaze,
in true adoration shall sing to Your praise!

<h3>My Soul Finds Rest (Psalm 62)</h3>
1. My soul finds rest in God alone,
My rock and my salvation.
A fortress strong against my foes,
and I will not be shaken.
Though lips may bless and hearts may curse,
and lies like arrows pierce me
I'll fix my heart on righteousness,
I'll look to him who hears me.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.
</section>
<section>
2. Find rest, my soul in God alone,
amid the world's temptations.
When evil seeks to take a hold,
I'll cling to my salvation.
Though riches come and riches go,
don't set your heart upon them.
The fields of hope in which I sow
are harvested in heaven.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.
</section>
<section>
3. I'll set my gaze on God alone,
and trust in Him completely,
With every day pour out my soul
and He will prove His mercy.
Though life is but a fleeting breath,
a sigh too brief to measure,
My King has crushed the curse of death
and I am His forever.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.

<h3>Before the Throne of God Above</h3>
1. Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
a great High Priest, whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is written on His hands,
my name is hidden in His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
no power can force me to depart.
</section>
<section>
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
who put an end to all my sin.
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me.
</section>
<section>
3. Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
my perfect, sinless Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
One with my Lord, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is safe with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.

<h3>Man of Sorrows</h3>
1. Man of sorrows! What a Name
for the Son of God, who came
ruined sinners to reclaim:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
</section>
<section>
2. Mocked by insults harsh and crude,
in my place condemned He stood;
sealed my pardon with His blood:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
</section>
<section>
3. Guilty, helpless, lost were we:
sinless Lamb of God was He,
sacrificed to set us free:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
</section>
<section>
4. He was lifted up to die:
'It is finished!' was His cry;
now in heav'n exalted high:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
</section>
<section>
5. When He comes, our glorious King,
all His ransomed home to bring;
then anew this song we'll sing:
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
