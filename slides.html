<h3>Rej 316: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</h3>
1. A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing.
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing:

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.
</section>
<section>
2. Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing.

You ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He.
The Lord of Hosts, His Name -
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.
</section>
<section>
3. And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us.

The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
we know his doom is sure,
the Word of God shall fell him.
</section>
<section>
4. That Word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, is standing;
the Spirit and His gifts are ours -
we answer His commanding.

Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill,
God's truth is ruling still -
His kingdom is forever!

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.

'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

<h3>MP 51: Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might,
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward,
    O Power of my power.
</section>
<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only be first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, when victory is won,
May I reach heaven's joys,
    O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
