<h3>Rej 380: Marvellous Grace of Our Loving Lord</h3>
1. Marvellous grace of our loving Lord,
grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
Yonder on Calvary's mount out-poured,
there where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!
</section>
<section>
2. Sin and despair, like the seawaves cold,
threaten the soul with infinite loss;
grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
points to the refuge, the mighty cross.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!
</section>
<section>
3. Dark is the stain that we cannot hide;
what can avail to wash it away?
Look: there is flowing a crimson tide --
whiter than snow you may be today.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!
</section>
<section>
4. Marvellous, infinite, matchless grace,
freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,
will you this moment His grace receive?
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!

<h3>PP 6: From the Squalor of a Borrowed Stable</h3>
1. From the squalor of a borrowed stable,
by the Spirit and a virgin's faith,
to the anguish and the pain of scandal,
came the Saviour of the human race!
</section>
<section>
But the skies were filled
with the praise of heaven,
shepherds listen as the angels tell
of the gift of God come down to man
at the dawning of Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
2. King of heaven now the Friend of sinners,
Humble servant in the Father's hands,
Filled with power and the Holy Spirit,
Filled with mercy for the broken man.
</section>
<section>
Yes, He walked my road and He felt my pain,
Joys and sorrows that I know so well;
Yes His righteous steps give me hope again -
I will follow my Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
3. Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal,
He was lifted on a cruel cross;
He was punished for a world's transgressions,
He was suffering to save the lost.
</section>
<section>
He fights for breath, He fights for me,
Loosing sinners from the claims of hell,
And with a shout our souls are free -
Death defeated by Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
4. Now He's standing in the place of honour,
Crowned with glory on the highest throne,
Interceding for own beloved
Till His Father calls to bring them home!
</section>
<section>
Then the skies will part as the trumpet sounds
Hope of heaven or the fear of hell,
But the Bride will run to her Lover's arms,
Giving glory to Immanuel!

<h3>Rej 586: It is well (When Peace Like a River)</h3>
1. When peace, like a river, 
flows all through my life,
when sorrows like sea billows roll;
whatever my lot, You have taught me to say:
It is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
2. Though Satan should buffet, 
though trials should come,
let this blest assurance control:
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate
and has shed His own blood for my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
4. My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought,
my sin, not in part, but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more:
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
5. And, Lord, haste the day when 
my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll:
the trumpet shall sound and the Lord shall descend,
'Even so' - it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
