<h3>PP 38: Across the Lands</h3>
1. You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand
</section>
<section>
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice
Let the skies declare Your glory
Let the land and seas rejoice
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
2. Yet You left the gaze of angels
Came to seek and save the lost
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross
</section>
<section>
With a prayer You fed the hungry
With a word You stilled the sea
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
3. With a shout You rose victorious
Wresting victory from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your wake
</section>
<section>
Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

<h3>My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.</h3>

<h3>MP 51: Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might,
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.
</section>
<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only be first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, when victory is won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.

<h3>Rej 529: How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds</h3>
1. How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
in a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
and drives away his fear.
</section>
<section>
2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
and calms the troubled breast;
is manna to the hungry soul,
and to the weary rest.
</section>
<section>
3. Dear Name! The Rock on which I build,
my shield and hiding-place,
my never-failing treasury filled
with boundless stores of grace.
</section>
<section>
4. Jesus! My Shepherd, Brother, Friend,
my Prophet, Priest and King,
my Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
accept the praise I bring.
</section>
<section>
5. Weak is the effort of my heart,
and cold my warmest thought;
but when I see You as You are,
I'll praise You as I ought.
</section>
<section>
6. Till then I would Your love proclaim
with every fleeting breath;
and may the music of Your Name
refresh my soul in death!

<h3>Rej 316: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</h3>
1. A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing.
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing:

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.
</section>
<section>
2. Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing.

You ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He.
The Lord of Hosts, His Name -
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.
</section>
<section>
3. And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us.

The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
we know his doom is sure,
the Word of God shall fell him.
</section>
<section>
4. That Word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, is standing;
the Spirit and His gifts are ours -
we answer His commanding.

Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill,
God's truth is ruling still -
His kingdom is forever!
