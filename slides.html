<h3>PP 37: 10,000 Reasons</h3>
<i>Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.</i>

1. The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
It's time to sing your song again.
Whatever may pass,
And whatever lies before me,
Let me be singing when the evening comes.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.

2. You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
Your name is great and your heart is kind.
For all your goodness, I will keep on singing;
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.

3. And on that day, when my strength is failing,
The end draws near, and my time has come;
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
