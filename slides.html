<h3>Rej 211: What Can Wash Away My Sin</h3>
1. What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh! Precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow;
no other fount I know,
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section>
2. For my pardon this I see:
nothing but the blood of Jesus;
for my cleansing, this my plea:
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh! Precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow;
no other fount I know,
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section>
3. Nothing can for sin atone,
nothing but the blood of Jesus;
naught of good that I have done,
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh! Precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow;
no other fount I know,
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section>
4. This is all my hope and peace:
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my righteousness:
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh! Precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow;
no other fount I know,
nothing but the blood of Jesus.

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
(Repeat)
