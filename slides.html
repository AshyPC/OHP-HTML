<h3>Rej 176: It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</h3>
1. It came upon the midnight clear,
that glorious song of old,
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold:
'Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
from heaven's all-gracious King!'
The world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing.
</section>
<section>
2. With sorrow brought by sin and strife
the world has suffered long
and, since the angels sang, have passed
two thousand years of wrong:
for man at war with man hears not
the love-song which they bring:
O hush the noise, you men of strife,
and hear the angels sing!
</section>
<section>
3. And those whose journey now is hard,
whose hope is burning low,
who tread the rocky path of life
with painful steps and slow:
O listen to the news of love
which makes the heavens ring!
O rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing!
</section>
<section>
4. And still the days are hastening on --
by prophets seen of old --
towards the fullness of the time
when comes the age foretold:
when earth and heaven renewed shall see
the Prince of Peace, their King;
and all the world repeat the song
which now the angels sing.

<h3>Rej 587: What a Wonderful Change</h3>

1. What a wonderful change
in my life has been wrought
since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul
which for long I had sought
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul
like the sea billows roll,
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section>
2. I have ceased from my wand'ring
and going astray,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And my sins, which were many,
are all washed away,
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul
like the sea billows roll,
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section>
3. I shall go there to dwell
in that City, I know,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And I'm happy, so happy,
as onward I go
since Jesus came into my heart.
