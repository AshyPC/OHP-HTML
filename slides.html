<h3>PP 37: 10,000 Reasons</h3>
<i>Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.</i>
</section>
<section>
1. The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
It's time to sing your song again.
Whatever may pass,
And whatever lies before me,
Let me be singing when the evening comes.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
</section>
<section>
2. You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
Your name is great and your heart is kind.
For all your goodness, I will keep on singing;
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
</section>
<section>
3. And on that day, when my strength is failing,
The end draws near, and my time has come;
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.

<h3>Rej 150: We Greet You, Sure Redeemer</h3>
1. We greet You, sure Redeemer from all strife,
our only Trust and Saviour of our life,
who pain did undergo for our poor sake;
we pray You from our hearts all cares to take.
</section>
<section>
2. You are the King of mercy and of grace,
reigning omnipotent in every place:
so come, O King, and our whole being sway;
shine on us with the light of Your pure day.
</section>
<section>
3. You are the life, in which we do believe,
from You all substance and all strength receive;
sustain us by Your faith and by Your power,
and give us strength in every trying hour.
</section>
<section>
4. You have the true and perfect gentleness;
You have no harshness and no bitterness:
O grant to us the grace in You we see
that we may dwell in perfect unity.
</section>

5. Our hope is in no other save in You;
our faith is built upon Your promise true;
Lord give us peace and make us calm and sure,
that in Your strength we evermore endure.

<h3>Rej 582: My Hope Is Built </h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus' Name.

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>

2. When weary in this earthly race,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
in every wild and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>

3. His oath, His covenant and blood
are my defence against the flood;
when earthly hopes are swept away
He will uphold me on that day.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>

4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
O may I still in Him be found!
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before His throne.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
