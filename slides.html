<h3>MP 51: Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word;
I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my battle-shield, sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight,
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.
</section>
<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, after victory won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.

<h3>Rej 157: The King of Love My Shepherd Is</h3>
The King of Love my Shepherd is,
whose goodness fails me never;
I nothing lack if I am His
and He is mine forever.
</section>
<section>
Where streams of living water flow
my ransomed soul He's leading,
and where the verdant pastures grow
with food celestial feeding.
</section>
<section>
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed;
but yet in love He sought me,
and on His shoulder gently laid,
and home rejoicing brought me.
</section>
<section>
In death's dark vale I fear no ill,
with You, dear Lord, beside me.
Your rod and staff my comfort still,
Your cross before to guide me.
</section>
<section>
You spread a table in my sight,
from enemies protect me,
Your presence is my chief delight,
Your grace is given freely.
</section>
<section>
And so through all the length of days
Your goodness fails me never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Your praise
within Your house forever!

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
