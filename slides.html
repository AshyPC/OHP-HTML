<h3>Where Wide Sky Rolls Down</h3>
<p1>1. Where wide sky rolls down</p1>
and touches red sand,
where sun turns to gold
the grass of the land,

let spinifex, mulga
and waterhole tell
their joy in the One
who made everything well.
</section>
<section>
2. Where rain-forest calm
meets reef, tide and storm,
where green things grow lush
and oceans are warm,

let every sea-creature
and tropical bird
exult in the light
of the life-giving Word.
</section>
<section>
3. Where red gum and creek
cross hillside and plain,
where cool tree-ferns rise
to welcome the rain,

let bushland, farm, mountain-top,
all of their days
delight in the Spirit
who formed them for praise.
</section>
<section>
4. Now, people of faith,
come gather around
with songs to be shared,
for blessings abound!

Australians, whatever
your culture or race,
come, lift up your hearts
to the Giver of grace.

<h3>Through the Love of God Our Saviour</h3>
1. Through the love of God our Saviour 
all will be well.
Free and changeless is His favour, 
all, all is well.
Precious is the blood that healed us;
perfect is the grace that sealed us;
strong the hand stretched forth to shield us; 
all must be well.
</section>
<section>
2. Though we pass through tribulation, 
all will be well.
Christ has purchased full salvation, 
all, all is well.
Happy still in God confiding,
fruitful if in Christ abiding,
holy through the Spirit's guiding; 
all must be well.
</section>
<section>
3. We expect a bright tomorrow; 
all will be well.
Faith can sing through days of sorrow: 
all, all is well.
On our Father's love relying,
Jesus every need supplying,
then in living or in dying 
all must be well.

<h3>God Has Spoken By His Prophets</h3>
1. God has spoken by His prophets,
spoken His unchanging Word;
each from age to age proclaiming
God the One, the righteous Lord;

in the world's despair and turmoil
one firm anchor still holds fast:
God is King, His throne eternal,
God the first and God the last.
</section>
<section>
2. God has spoken by Christ Jesus,
Christ, the everlasting Son;
brightness of the Father's glory,
with the Father ever one:

spoken by the Word incarnate,
God, before all time began,
Light of light, to earth descending,
Man, revealing God to man.
</section>
<section>
3. God is speaking by His Spirit
speaking to the hearts of men;
in the age-long Word expounding
God's own message, now as then.

Through the rise and fall of nations
one sure faith is standing fast:
God abides, His Word unchanging,
God the first and God the last.

<h3>I am Carried</h3>
1. Day by day and hour by hour,
Your love for me from heaven flows
Like streams of water in the desert
living waters flow.
You walk beside me, gently guiding,
Leading me through every storm.
Ever lasting, never changing,
grace and love divine.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
I am held by hands of healing,
Washed by water pure.
Lifting up my heavy heart,
Held in grace-scarred hands.
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
</section>
<section>
2. Mercy's healing grace relieving
Every spot and every stain.
forgiven freely, no more guilty,
Love has conquered shame.
The broken mended, night has ended,
Lost and lonely, lost no more,
For I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
I am held by hands of healing,
Washed by water pure.
Lifting up my heavy heart,
Held in grace-scarred hands.
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
</section>
<section>
3. Never worthy, never earning,
All my works now left behind.
Ever onwards, ever upwards,
You've called me on to rise.
Above my darkness, all my failure,
Every fear and every pain -
Always carried, always covered
by grace and love divine.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
I am held by hands of healing,
Washed by water pure.
Lifting up my heavy heart,
Held in grace-scarred hands.
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
