<h3>RCM 212: Our God Reigns</h3>
1. How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
Who brings good news—good news
Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
Saying to Zion: your God reigns!

<i>Your God reigns! Your God reigns!
Your God reigns! Your God reigns!</i>
</section>
<section>
2. He had no stately form, He had no majesty,
That we should be—drawn to Him.
He was despised, and we took no account of Him,
Yet now He reigns... with the Most High!

<i>Now He reigns! Now He reigns!
Now He reigns... with the Most High!</i>
</section>

3. It was our sin that pierced and wounded Him
It was our sin—that brought Him down
When we, like sheep, had gone astray, our Shepherd came
And on His shoulders—bore our shame.

<i>On His shoulders... On His shoulders...
On His shoulders... He bore our shame.</i>

4. Meek as a lamb that's led out to the slaughter-house
Dumb as a sheep—before its shearer
His life ran down upon the ground, like pouring rain,
That we might be—born again!

<i>That we might be... That we might be...
That we might be... born again!</i>
</section>
<section>
5. Out from the tomb He came, with grace and majesty,
He is alive—He is alive.
God loves us so—see here his hands, his feet, his side
Yes, we know—He is alive.

<i>He is alive... He is alive...
He is alive... He is alive.</i>
</section>

6. How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
Who brings good news—good news
Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
Our God reigns—Our God reigns!

<i>Our God reigns... Our God reigns...
Our God reigns.... Our God reigns!</i>
