<h3>Rej 370: We Have Heard The Joyful Sound</h3>
1. We have heard the joyful sound:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to ev'ry land,
climb the steeps and cross the waves;
onward -- 'tis our Lord's command:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
2. Waft it on the rolling tide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing, O islands of the sea!
Echo back, you ocean caves!
Earth shall keep her jubilee:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
3. Sing above the battle strife:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
By His death and endless life:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing it softly through the gloom,
when the heart for mercy craves;
sing in triumph o'er the tomb:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
4. Give the winds a mighty voice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free,
highest hills and deepest caves;
this our song of victory:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

<h3>MP 236: Holy Child</h3>
1. Holy child, how still You lie!
safe the manger, soft the hay;
faint upon the eastern sky
breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
</section>
<section>
2. Holy child, Whose birthday brings
shepherds from their field and fold,
angel choirs and eastern kings,
myrrh and frankincense and gold;
</section>
<section>
3. Holy child, what gift of grace
from the Father freely willed!
In Your infant form we trace
all God's promises fulfilled.
</section>
<section>
4. Holy child, whose human years
span like ours delight and pain;
one in human joys and tears,
one in all but sin and stain
</section>
<section>
5. Holy child, so far from home,
all the lost to seek and save,
to what dreadful death You come,
to what dark and silent grave!
</section>
<section>
6. Holy child, before Whose Name
powers of darkness faint and fall;
conquered death and sin and shame -
Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
</section>
<section>
7. Holy child, how still You lie!
safe the manger, soft the hay;
clear upon the eastern sky
breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
