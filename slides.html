<h3>Rej 316: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</h3>
A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing.
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing:
</section>
<section>
for still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.
</section>
<section>
Did we in our own strength onfide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing.
</section>
<section>
You ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He.
The Lord of Hosts, His Name -
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.
</section>
<section>
And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us.
</section>
<section>
The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
we know his doom is sure,
the Word of God shall fell him.
</section>
<section>
That Word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, is standing;
the Spirit and His gifts are ours -
we answer His commanding.
</section>
<section>
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill,
God's truth is ruling still -
His kingdom is forever!

<h3>Rej 515: Search Me, O God</h3>
Search me, O God, and know my heart today;
try me, O Saviour, know my thoughts, I pray.
See if there be some wicked way in me.
Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.
</section>
<section>
I praise You, Lord, for cleansing me from sin.
Fulfil Your Word and make me pure within.
Fill me with fire where once I burned with shame;
grant my desire to magnify Your Name.
</section>
<section>
Lord, take my life, my sinful soul refine;
fill my poor heart with Your great love divine.
Take all my will, my passion, self, and pride;
I now surrender, Lord, in my abide.
</section>
<section>
Spirit of God, I would Your temple be.
Send a revival - start the work in me.
Your Word declares You will supply our need;
for blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
