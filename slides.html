<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>

2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.

3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>

4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
