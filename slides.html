<h3>Rej 12: Stand Up and Bless The Lord</h3>
1. Stand up and bless the Lord,
you people of His choice;
stand up and praise the Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.
</section>
<section>
2. Though high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His Holy Name,
give thanks and glorify?

3. O for the living flame
from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our minds inspire,
and wing to heaven our thought!
</section>
<section>
4. God is our strength and song,
and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed
with all our ransomed powers.

5. Stand up and bless the Lord,
the Lord your God adore;
stand up and praise His glorious Name
both now and evermore.
