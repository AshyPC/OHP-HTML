<h3>PP 4: Come, People of the Risen King</h3>
1. Come, people of the Risen King,
who delight to bring Him praise.
Come all, and tune your hearts to sing
to the Morning Star of grace.
</section>
<section>
From the shifting shadows of the earth
we will lift our eyes to Him,
where steady arms of mercy reach
to gather children in.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Rejoice, Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice;
O Church of Christ, rejoice!
</section>
<section>
2. Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
and those weeping through the night.
Come, those who tell of battles won,
and those struggling in the fight.
</section>
<section>
For His perfect love will never change,
and His mercies never cease,
but follow us through all our days
with the certain hope of peace.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Rejoice, Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice;
O Church of Christ, rejoice!
</section>
<section>
3. Come, young and old from every land,
men and women of the faith.
Come, those with full or empty hands,
find the riches of His grace.
</section>
<section>
Over all the world, His people sing;
shore to shore we hear them call
the Truth that cries through every age:
"Our God is all in all"!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Rejoice, Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice;
O Church of Christ, rejoice!

Child of weakness, watch and pray,
find in me thine all in all

Can change the leper's spots

<h3>PP 24: Lamb Of God (Your Only Son)</h3>
1. Your only Son, no sin to hide
But You have sent Him from Your side
To walk upon this guilty sod
And to become the Lamb of God.
</section>
<section>
2. Your gift of love they crucified;
They laughed and scorned Him as He died;
The humble King they named a fraud
And sacrificed the Lamb of God.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God
Oh, wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
</section>
<section>
3. I was so lost I should have died
But You have brought me to Your side
To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God
Oh, wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.

<h3>Rej 386: Amazing Grace</h3>
1. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
was blind, but now I see.
</section>
<section>
2. That grace first taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved;
how precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed!
</section>
<section>
3. Through many dangers, trials and snares
I have already come;
His grace has brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.
</section>
<section>
4. The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
my Shield and Stronghold He shall be
as long as life endures.
</section>
<section>
5. And when this earthly life is past,
and mortal cares shall cease,
I shall possess with Christ at last
eternal joy and peace.
</section>
<section>
6. When we've been there ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun,
we've no less days to sing God's praise
than when we'd first begun.

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.

<h3>PP 53: Create in Me a Clean Heart</h3>
Create in me a clean heart O God,
And renew a right spirit within me.
Create in me a clean heart O God,
And renew a right spirit within me.
</section>
<section>
Cast me not away from Thy presence
And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
And renew a right spitir within me.
