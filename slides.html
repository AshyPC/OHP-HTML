<h3>MP 975: Before the Throne of God Above</h3>
1. Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
a great High Priest, whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
</section>
<section>
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
</section>
<section>
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
who made an end of all my sin.
</section>
<section>
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.
</section>
<section>
3. Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
</section>
<section>
One with Himself, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.

<h3>MP 200: Great is Thy Faithfulness</h3>
1. Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
there is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not,
as Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see;
all I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
</section>
<section>
2. Summer and winter, and spring-time and harvest,
sun, moon and stars in their courses above
join with all nature in manifold witness
th Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see;
all I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
</section>
<section>
3. Pardon for sin, and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see;
all I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.

<h3>Rej 582: My Hope Is Built</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus' Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
2. When weary in this earthly race,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
in every wild and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
3. His oath, His covenant and blood
are my defence against the flood;
when earthly hopes are swept away
He will uphold me on that day.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
O may I still in Him be found!
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before His throne.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.

<h3>1. God Fulfils His Promise</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>
It comes to a climax here as David is made king of all of Israel for the first time.
</section>
<section class=black>
One thing that never changes: God’s Promise
</section>
<section class=black>
God is Faithful
</section>
<section class=black>
All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood.  In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’” 

(2 Samuel 5:1-2)
</section>
<section class=black>
All the chaos after requesting for a king is a result of the people’s unfaithfulness

<h3>2. Flaws in humanity</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>
David’s reign seems perfect
</section>
<section class=black>
On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”
(Genesis 15:18-21)
</section>
<section class=black>
The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.
(Judges 1:21)
</section>
<section class=black>
<u>Jebusites’ arrogance</u>: “You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David cannot get in here.” (v. 6)
<u>David’s victory</u>: Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David… David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. (v. 7,9)
</section>
<section class=black>
And he became more and more powerful, because the Lord God Almighty was with him. (v. 10)
</section>
<section class=black>
<u>David is also flawed</u>: After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,  Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet. (v. 13-16)
</section>
<section class=black>
We can only depend on God. We can only depend on Jesus’ forgiveness of the cross. We can only rely on the Holy Spirit to work in us and the church.

<h3>3. God’s Deliverance</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>
It is not ultimately David who protects and defends them.
</section>
<section class=black>
Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; so David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?” (v. 18-19)
</section>
<section class=black>
“Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. ₂₄ As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move quickly, because that will mean the Lord has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.” (v.23-24)
</section>
<section class=black>
God is our protector and defender
<aside>God was the warrior David was counting on.
God was the warrior that he trusted to go before them to win the battle</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, the Lord has broken out against my enemies before me.” So that place was called Baal Perazim. The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off. (v. 20-21)
</section>
<section class=black>
David was very much living in the example of Jesus:
Jesus said: “By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.” (John 5:30)
</section>
<section class=black>
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”
(Revelation 21:3-4)
</section>
<section class=black>
We can labour in joy

“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 
(Mark 10:45)

<h3>PP 2: Behold The Lamb</h3>
1. Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
slain for us
and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of peace
around the table of the King.
</section>
<section>
2. The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
torn for you
eat and remember:
The wounds that heal,
the death that brings us life
paid the price to make us one.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign

3. The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
shed for you
drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
to receive the life of God.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of grace
around the table of the King.

<section>
4. And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
to respond
and to remember
our call to follow in the steps of Christ
as His body here on earth.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
As we share
in His suffering,
we proclaim
Christ will come again!
And we'll join
in the feast of heaven
around the table of the King.
