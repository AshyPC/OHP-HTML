<h3>Rej 11: Give to Our God Immortal Praise</h3>
1. Give to our God immortal praise,
mercy and truth are all His ways;
wonders of grace to God belong:
repeat His mercies in your song.
</section>
<section>
2. Give to the Lord of lords renown,
the King of kings with glory crown;
His mercies ever shall endure
when lords and kings are known no more.
</section>
<section>
3. He built the earth, He spread the sky,
He fixed the starry lights on high;
wonders of grace to God belong:
repeat His mercies in your song.
</section>
<section>
4. He fills the sun with morning light,
He bids the moon direct the night;
His mercies ever shall endure
when suns and moons shall shine no more.
</section>
<section>
5. He sent His Son with power to save
from guilt and darkness and the grave;
wonders of grace to God belong:
repeat His mercies in your song.
</section>
<section>
6. All through this world He guides our feet
and leads us to His heavenly seat;
His mercies ever shall endure
when this our world shall be no more.

<h3>PP 39: This Life I Live</h3>
1. This life I live is not my own,
For my Redeemer paid the price.
He took it to be his alone,
To be his treasure and his prize.
</section>
<section>
The things of earth I leave behind
To live in worship of my King.
His is the right to rule my life,
Mine is the joy to live for him.
</section>
<section>
2. I died to sin upon the cross.
I'm bound to Jesus in his death.
The old is gone, and now I must
Rely on him for every breath.
</section>
<section>
With every footstep that I tread,
What mysteries he has in store.
I cannot know what lies ahead,
But know that he has gone before.
</section>
<section>
3. There is a voice that pierced the grave,
A power that rolled the stone away.
A sound of life, I know I'm saved,
The voice of God has called my name.
</section>
<section>
So I will rise, and in the air
Behold the glory of the King.
I will not fear to meet him there.
I know my life is hid with him.

<h3>Rej 254: Jesus Comes With Clouds Descending</h3>
1. Jesus comes with clouds descending,
see the Lamb for sinners slain!
Thousand thousand saints attending
join to sing the glad refrain:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
God appears on earth to reign.
</section>
<section>
2. Every eye shall then behold Him
robed in awesome majesty;
those who jeered at Him and sold Him,
pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
shamed and grieving, shamed and grieving,
shamed and grieving,
shall their true Messiah see.
</section>
<section>
3. Now redemption, long expected,
see in majesty appear;
all His saints by man rejected
now shall meet Him in the air.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
See the day of God appear.
</section>
<section>
4. Lord, amen! Let all adore You
high on Your eternal throne;
crowns and empires fall before You:
claim the Kingdom for Your own.
Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!
Everlasting God, come down.

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
(Repeat)
