<h3>Rej 9: O Worship The King, All Glorious Above</h3>
1. O worship the King all glorious above,
and gratefully sing His power and His love;
our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise.
</section>
<section>
2. O tell of His might and sing of His grace,
whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
</section>
<section>
3. The earth, with its store of wonders untold,
Almighty, Your power has founded of old;
established it fast by Your changeless decree,
and round it has cast like a mantle the sea.
</section>
<section>
4. Your bountiful care what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.
</section>
<section>
5. We children of dust are feeble and frail:
in You we will trust, for You never fail;
Your mercies are tender, and firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.
</section>
<section>
6. O measureless Might, unchangeable Love,
whom angels delight to worship above!
Your ransomed creation with glory ablaze,
in true adoration shall sing to Your praise!

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

<h3>PP 2: Behold The Lamb (Communion Hymn)</h3>
1. Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
slain for us_
and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.

<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of peace
around the table of the King.

2. The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
torn for you_
eat and remember:
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life
paid the price to make us one.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of love
around the table of the King.

3. The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
shed for you_
drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
to receive the life of God.

So we share
in this bread of life,

<section>
4. And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
to respond_
and to remember
our call to follow in the steps of Christ
as His body here on earth.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
As we share
in His suffering,
we proclaim
Christ will come again!
And we'll join
in the feast of heaven
around the table of the King.
