<h3>Rej 440: O the deep, deep love of Jesus</h3>
1. O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
vast, unmeasured, boundless, free,
rolling as a mighty ocean
in its fullness over me!
</section>
<section>
Underneath me, all around me,
is the current of His love;
leading onward, leading homeward
to that glorious rest above.
</section>
<section>
2. O the deep, deep love of Jesus --
spread His praise from shore to shore!
He who loves us, ever loves us,
changes never, nevermore;
</section>
<section>
He who died to save His loved ones
intercedes for them above;
He who called them His own people
watches over them in love.
</section>
<section>
3. O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
love of every love the best;
vast the ocean of His blessing,
sweet the haven of His rest!
</section>
<section>
O the deep, deep love of Jesus --
for my Heaven of heavens is He;
this my everlasting glory:
Jesus' mighty love for me!

<h3>Rej 590: Come, we that love the Lord</h3>

and let our joys be known:
join in a song with sweet accord,
join in a song with sweet accord,
and thus surround the throne,
and thus surround the throne.

the beautiful City of God.

who never knew our God;
but children of the heavenly King,
but children of the heavenly King,
must speak their joys abroad,
must speak their joys abroad.

from faith and hope may grow,
from faith and hope may grow.

a thousand sacred sweets,
before we reach the heavenly fields,
before we reach the heavenly fields,
or walk the golden streets,
or walk the golden streets.

and never, never sin,
but from the rivers of His Grace,
but from the rivers of His Grace,
drink endless pleasures in,
drink endless pleasures in.

and every tear be dry;
we're marching through Immanuel's ground,
we're marching through Immanuel's ground,
to fairer worlds on high,
to fairer worlds on high.
