<h3>Rej 12: Stand Up and Bless The Lord</h3>
1. Stand up and bless the Lord,
you people of His choice;
stand up and praise the Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.
</section>
<section>
2. Though high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His Holy Name,
give thanks and glorify?

3. O for the living flame
from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our minds inspire,
and wing to heaven our thought!
</section>
<section>
4. God is our strength and song,
and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed
with all our ransomed powers.

5. Stand up and bless the Lord,
the Lord your God adore;
stand up and praise His glorious Name
both now and evermore.

<h3>MP 126: Facing a Task Unfinished (Aurelia)</h3>
1. Facing a task unfinished
that drives us to our knees,
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease,
</section>
<section>
We who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before Thy throne
the solemn pledge we owe Thee,
to go and make Thee known.
</section>
<section>
2. Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway,
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today,
</section>
<section>
With none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light,
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.
</section>
<section>
3. We bear the torch that, flaming,
fell from the hands of those
who gave their lives, proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose.
</section>
<section>
Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours
fired by the same ambition
to Thee we yield our powers.
</section>
<section>
4. O Father Who sustained them
O Spirit Who inspired
Saviour, Whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired...
</section>
<section>
from cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us,
to labour for Thy sake.

<h3>MP 15: All Heaven Waits</h3>
1. All heaven waits with bated breath
for saints on earth to pray;
majestic angels ready stand
with swords of fiery blade.
Astounding power awaits a word
from God's resplendent throne...
but God awaits our prayer of faith
that cries, "Your will be done!"
</section>
<section>
2. Awake, O church, arise and pray,
complaining words discard;
the Spirit comes to fill your mouth
with truth, His mighty sword.
Go place your feet on Satan's ground
and there proclaim Christ's name...
In step with heaven's armies march,
to conquer and to reign!
</section>
<section>
3. Now in our hearts and on our lips
the word of faith is near;
Let heaven's will on earth be done
let heaven flow from here.
Come blend your prayers with Jesus' own
before the Father's throne...
And as the incense clouds ascend,
God's holy fire rains down!
</section>
<section>
4. Soon comes the day when with a shout,
King Jesus shall appear;
And with Him all the church
from every age shall fill the air!
The brightness of His coming shall
consume the lawless one...
As with a word the breath of God
tears down his rebel throne.
</section>
<section>
5. One body here by heaven inspired, 
we seek prophetic power;
in Christ agreed one heart and voice
to speak this day, this hour.
In every place where chaos rules,
and evil forces brood...
let Jesus' voice speak like the roar 
of a great multitude!
