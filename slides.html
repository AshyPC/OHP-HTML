<h3>MP 51: Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might,
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.
</section>
<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only be first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, when victory is won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.

<h3>PP 43: My Heart Is Filled</h3>
1. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who bore my pain;
Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace
and gave me life again;
</section>
<section>
Who crushed my curse of sinfulness,
and clothed me in His light,
and wrote His law of righteousness
with power upon my heart.
</section>
<section>
2. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who walks beside;
Who floods my weaknesses with strength
and causes fear to fly;
</section>
<section>
Whose every promise is enough
for every step I take;
sustaining me with arms of love
and crowning me with grace.
</section>
<section>
3. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who reigns above;
Whose wisdom is my perfect peace,
Whose every thought is love.
</section>
<section>
For every day I have on earth
is given by the King.
So I will give my life, my all,
to love and follow Him.

<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

<h3>PP 2: Behold The Lamb (Communion Hymn)</h3>
1. Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
slain for us_
and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of peace
around the table of the King.

2. The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
torn for you_
eat and remember:
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life
paid the price to make us one.

So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of love
around the table of the King.

3. The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
shed for you_
drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
to receive the life of God.

So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice

of our bonds of grace

4. And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
to respond_
and to remember
our call to follow in the steps of Christ
as His body here on earth.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
As we share
in His suffering,
we proclaim
Christ will come again!
And we'll join
in the feast of heaven
around the table of the King.
