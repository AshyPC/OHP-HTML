<h3>PP 33: Calvary</h3>
You exchanged my curses for blessings
And traded my sickness for health;
You removed my guilt with forgiveness
And supply all my needs from Your wealth;
For my hatred you've given Your perfect love
And peace in place of my strife,
You have given me faith instead of doubt,
The death that You died gave me life.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Calvary! We're set free!
By His blood we have been redeemed!
Calvary! Liberty!
He has conquered! We have victory!

<h3>Rej 455: Onward, Christian Soldiers</h3>

Christ, the Royal Master,
leads His armies on:
forward into battle
till the fight is won!

Brothers, we are treading
where the saints have trod.

We are not divided
All one body, we

on to victory!

at the shout of praise.
Sing the song of triumph!
Loud your voices raise!

Death and hell and Satan
never shall prevail;
we have Christ's own promise,
and that cannot fail.

Blend with ours your voices
in the triumph song

give to Christ the King!
This through countless ages
men and angels sing:

<h3>MP 14: All Heaven Declares</h3>
1. All heaven declares
The glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare
With the beauty of the Lord?
</section>
<section>
Forever He will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow the knee
And worship Him alone.
</section>

2. I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain
To reconcile a man to God

<section>
Forever You will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee
And worship You alone.
