<h3>MP 975: Before the Throne of God Above</h3>
1. Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
a great High Priest, whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
</section>
<section>
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
</section>
<section>
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
who made an end of all my sin.
</section>
<section>
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.
</section>
<section>
3. Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
</section>
<section>
One with Himself, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.

<h3>PP 24: Lamb Of God (Your Only Son)</h3>
1. Your only Son, no sin to hide
But You have sent Him from Your side
To walk upon this guilty sod
And to become the Lamb of God.
</section>
<section>
2. Your gift of love they crucified;
They laughed and scorned Him as He died;
The humble King they named a fraud
And sacrificed the Lamb of God.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God
Oh, wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
</section>
<section>
3. I was so lost I should have died
But You have brought me to Your side
To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God
Oh, wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.

<h3>PP 19: Speak, O Lord</h3>
1. Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us 
All Your purposes for Your glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow’r that can never fail -
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.
</section>
<section>
3. Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us -
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we’ll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we’ll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

<h3>Rej 310: Brother, Let Me Be Your Servant</h3>
1. Brother, let me be your servant,
let me be as Christ to you.
Pray that I might have the grace
to let you be my servant, too.
</section>
<section>
2. We are pilgrims on a journey,
we are brothers on the road,
we are here to help each other
walk the mile and bear the load.
</section>
<section>
3. I will hold the Christ-light for you
in the night-time of your fear;
I will hold my hand out to you,
speak the peace you long to hear.
</section>
<section>
4. I will weep when you are weeping,
when you laugh I'll laugh with you,
I will share your joy and sorrow
till we've seen this journey through.
</section>
<section>
5. When we sing to God in heaven
we shall find such harmony
born of all we've known together
of Christ's love and agony.
</section>
<section>
6. Brother, let me be your servant,
let me be as Christ to you.
Pray that I might have the grace
to let you be my servant, too.
