The Lamb upon His throne,<br>
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns<br>
all music but its own!<br>

<pre>Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.</pre>

<pre>2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:</pre>
</section>
<section>
<pre>His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.</pre>
