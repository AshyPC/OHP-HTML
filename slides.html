<h3>PP 3: By Faith</h3>
1. By faith we see the hand of God
in the light of creation's grand design,
in the lives of those who prove His faithfulness,
who walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
2. By faith our fathers roamed the earth
with the power of His promise in their hearts,
of a holy city built by God's own hand,
a place where peace and justice reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
3. By faith the prophets saw a day
when the longed-for Messiah would appear
with the power to break
the chains of sin and death
and rise triumphant from the grave.
</section>
<section>
4. By faith the church was called to go
in the power of the Spirit to the lost
to deliver captives and to preach good news
in every corner of the earth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
5. By faith this mountain shall be moved
and the power of the gospel shall prevail,
for we know in Christ all things are possible
for all who call upon His Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.

<h3>MP 506: How Great Thou Art</h3>
1. O Lord my God,
when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works Thy hand has made;
I see the stars,
I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
</section>
<section>
2. And when I think
that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die - I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin:
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
</section>
<section>
3. When Christ shall come
with shout of acclamation,
And take me home - what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And then proclaim,
"My God, how great Thou art!"
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

<h3>Rej 586: When Peace Like a River</h3>
1. When peace, like a river, 
flows all through my life,
when sorrows like sea billows roll;
whatever my lot, You have taught me to say:
It is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
2. Though Satan should buffet, 
though trials should come,
let this blest assurance control:
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate
and has shed His own blood for my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
3. My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought,
my sin, not in part, but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more:
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
4. And, Lord, haste the day when 
my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll:
the trumpet shall sound and the Lord shall descend,
'Even so' - it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
