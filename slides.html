<h3>Rej 441: Love Divine, All Loves Excelling</h3>
1. Love divine, all loves excelling,
joy of heav'n to earth come down;
fix in us Your humble dwelling,
all Your faithful mercies crown.
</section>
<section>
Jesus You are all compassion,
boundless love that makes us whole;
visit us with Your salvation,
enter ev'ry trembling soul.
</section>
<section>
2. Come, Almighty, to deliver,
let us all Your grace receive;
suddenly return and never,
never more Your temple leave.
</section>
<section>
You we would be always blessing,
serve You as Your hosts above,
pray, and praise You without ceasing,
glory in Your perfect love.
</section>
<section>
3. Finish then Your new creation;:
pure and sinless let us be;
let us see Your great salvation,
perfect in eternity;
</section>
<section>
changed from glory into glory
till in heav'n we take our place,
there to cast our crowns before You,
lost in wonder, love and praise!

<h3>Rej 257: When the Trumpet of the Lord Shall Sound</h3>
1. When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
and time shall be no more,
and the morning breaks -- eternal, bright, and fair;
when the saved of earth shall gather
over on the other shore,
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
When the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
</section>
<section>
2. On that bright and cloudless morning
when the dead in Christ shall rise,
and the glory of His resurrection share;
when His chosen ones shall gather
to their home beyond the skies,
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
When the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
</section>
<section>
3. Let me labour for the Master
from the dawn till setting sun;
let me speak of all His wondrous love and care.
Then when all of life is over,
and our work on earth is done,
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
When the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder,
when the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

<h3>Rej 13: Exalt the Lord, His Praise Proclaim</h3>
1. Exalt the Lord, His praise proclaim;
all you His servants, praise His Name,
who in the Lord's House always stand
and humbly serve at His command.
</section>
<section>
The Lord is good, His praise proclaim;
since it is pleasant, praise His Name;
His people for His own He takes
and His distinctive treasure makes.
</section>
<section>
2. I know the Lord is high in state,
above all gods our God is great;
the Lord performs what He decrees,
in heav'n and earth, in depths and seas.
</section>
<section>
He makes the moisture to ascend
in clouds from earth's remotest end;
the lightnings flash at His command;
He holds the cyclone in His hand.
</section>
<section>
3. Exalt the Lord, His praise proclaim;
all you His servants, praise His Name,
who in the Lord's House always stand
and humbly serve at His command.

Forever praise and bless His Name,
and in the church His praise proclaim;
in Zion is His dwelling place;
O praise the Lord, show forth His grace.
