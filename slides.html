<h1>Crown Him With Many Crowns</h1>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
</section>
<section>
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
</section>
<section>
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side --
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
</section>
<section>
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace --
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
</section>
<section>
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
</section>
<section>
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!
<cite>Matthew Bridges 1800-1894 and Godfrey Thring 1823-1903</cite>

<h1>You Servants of God</h1>
1. You servants of God, your master proclaim,
and publish abroad His wonderful Name;
the Name all-victorious of Jesus extol,
His Kingdom is glorious and rules over all.
</section>
<section>
2. God rules in the height, almighty to save;
though hid from our sight His presence we have.
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.
</section>
<section>
3. 'Salvation to God who sits on the throne!'
Let all cry aloud, and honour the Son;
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.
</section>
<section>
4. Then let us adore and give Him His right:
all glory and power, all wisdom and might,
all honour and blessing with angels above
and thanks never ceasing, and infinite love.

<h1>Make Me A Captive, Lord</h1>
1. Make me a captive, Lord,
and then I shall be free;
force me to render up my sword,
and I shall conqueror be.
</section>
<section>
I sink in life's alarms
when by myself I stand;
imprison me within Your arms,
and strong shall be my hand.
</section>
<section>
2. My heart is weak and poor
until its Master find;
it has no spring of action sure;
it varies with the wind.
</section>
<section>
It cannot feely move
unless You should restrain;
enslave it with Your matchless love,
and deathless it shall reign.
</section>
<section>
3. My power is faint and low
till I have learned to serve;
it wants the needed fire to glow,
it wants the breeze to nerve;
</section>
<section>
it cannot drive the world
until itself be driven;
its flag can only be unfurled
when You shall breathe from heaven.
</section>
<section>
4. My will is not my own
while ever it is mine;
if it would reach a monarch's throne
it must its crown resign.
</section>
<section>
It only stands unbent
amid the clashing strife,
when on Your shoulder it has leant,
and found in You its life.
