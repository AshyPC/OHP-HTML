<h3>Rej 246: Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side -
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace -
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!

<h3>PP 13: Man of Sorrows</h3>
1. Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
by His own betrayed;
The sin of man and wrath of God
has been on Jesus laid.
</section>
<section>
2. Silent as He stood accused,
beaten, mocked, and scorned;
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns.

<section class=refrain>
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation,
where Your love poured out over me;
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah"!
Praise and honour unto Thee.

3. Sent of heaven, God's own Son,
to purchase and redeem
and reconcile the very ones
who nailed Him to that tree!

Whom the Son sets free
oh is free indeed!

and the power of the gospel shall prevail,
for we know in Christ all things are possible
for all who call upon His Name.

We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.

'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
