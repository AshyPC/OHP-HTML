<h3>MP 52: Because He lives</h3>
1. God sent His son, they called him Jesus,
He came to love, heal, and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon.
An empty grave is there to prove
my Saviour lives!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow;
Because He lives, all fear is gone!
Because I know He holds the future,
and life is worth the living,
just because He lives.
</section>
<section>
2. How sweet to hold a new-born baby,
And feel the pride and joy he brings,
But greater still, the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days
because <em>He</em> lives.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow;
Because He lives, all fear is gone!
Because I know He holds the future,
and life is worth the living, just because He lives.
</section>
<section>
3. And then, one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain.
And then as death gives way to victory,
I'll see the light of glory and I'll know He lives.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
Because He lives, all fear is gone!
Because I know He holds the future,
and life is worth the living, just because He lives.

<h3>PP 38: Across the Lands</h3>
1. You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand
</section>
<section>
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice
Let the skies declare Your glory
Let the land and seas rejoice
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
2. Yet You left the gaze of angels
Came to seek and save the lost
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross
</section>
<section>
With a prayer You fed the hungry
With a word You stilled the sea
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
3. With a shout You rose victorious
Wresting victory from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your wake
</section>
<section>
Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

<h3>PP 3: By Faith</h3>
1. By faith we see the hand of God
in the light of creation's grand design,
in the lives of those who prove His faithfulness,
who walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
2. By faith our fathers roamed the earth
with the power of His promise in their hearts,
of a holy city built by God's own hand,
a place where peace and justice reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
3. By faith the prophets saw a day
when the longed-for Messiah would appear
with the power to break
the chains of sin and death
and rise triumphant from the grave.
</section>
<section>
4. By faith the church was called to go
in the power of the Spirit to the lost
to deliver captives and to preach good news
in every corner of the earth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
5. By faith this mountain shall be moved
and the power of the gospel shall prevail,
for we know in Christ all things are possible
for all who call upon His Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.

<h3>PP 39: This Life I Live</h3>
1. This life I live is not my own,
For my Redeemer paid the price.
He took it to be his alone,
To be his treasure and his prize.
</section>
<section>
The things of earth I leave behind
To live in worship of my King.
His is the right to rule my life,
Mine is the joy to live for him.
</section>
<section>
2. I died to sin upon the cross.
I'm bound to Jesus in his death.
The old is gone, and now I must
Rely on him for every breath.
</section>
<section>
With every footstep that I tread,
What mysteries he has in store.
I cannot know what lies ahead,
But know that he has gone before.
</section>
<section>
3. There is a voice that pierced the grave,
A power that rolled the stone away.
A sound of life, I know I'm saved,
The voice of God has called my name.
</section>
<section>
So I will rise, and in the air
Behold the glory of the King.
I will not fear to meet him there.
I know my life is hid with him.
(Repeat)
