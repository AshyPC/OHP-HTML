<h3>PP 3: By Faith</h3>
1. By faith we see the hand of God
in the light of creation's grand design,
in the lives of those who prove His faithfulness,
who walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
2. By faith our fathers roamed the earth
with the power of His promise in their hearts,
of a holy city built by God's own hand,
a place where peace and justice reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
3. By faith the prophets saw a day
when the longed-for Messiah would appear
with the power to break
the chains of sin and death
and rise triumphant from the grave.
</section>
<section>
4. By faith the church was called to go
in the power of the Spirit to the lost
to deliver captives and to preach good news
in every corner of the earth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
5. By faith this mountain shall be moved
and the power of the gospel shall prevail,
for we know in Christ all things are possible
for all who call upon His Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.

<h3>PP 38: Across the Lands</h3>
1. You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand
</section>
<section>
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice
Let the skies declare Your glory
Let the land and seas rejoice
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
2. Yet You left the gaze of angels
Came to seek and save the lost
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross
</section>
<section>
With a prayer You fed the hungry
With a word You stilled the sea
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
3. With a shout You rose victorious
Wresting victory from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your wake
</section>
<section>
Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

<h3>PP 48: Facing a Task Unfinished</h3>
1. Facing a task unfinished
that drives us to our knees,
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease,
</section>
<section>
We who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before Thy throne
the solemn pledge we owe Thee,
to go and make Thee known.
</section>
<section>
2. Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway,
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today,
</section>
<section>
With none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light,
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled.
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord.
</section>
<section>
3. We bear the torch that, flaming,
fell from the hands of those
who gave their lives, proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose.
</section>
<section>
Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours
fired by the same ambition
to Thee we yield our powers.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled.
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord.
</section>
<section>
4. O Father Who sustained them
O Spirit Who inspired
Saviour, Whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired...
</section>
<section>
from cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us,
to labour for Thy sake.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled.
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord.

<h3>PP 39: This Life I Live</h3>
1. This life I live is not my own,
For my Redeemer paid the price.
He took it to be his alone,
To be his treasure and his prize.
</section>
<section>
The things of earth I leave behind
To live in worship of my King.
His is the right to rule my life,
Mine is the joy to live for him.
</section>
<section>
2. I died to sin upon the cross.
I'm bound to Jesus in his death.
The old is gone, and now I must
Rely on him for every breath.
</section>
<section>
With every footstep that I tread,
What mysteries he has in store.
I cannot know what lies ahead,
But know that he has gone before.
</section>
<section>
3. There is a voice that pierced the grave,
A power that rolled the stone away.
A sound of life, I know I'm saved,
The voice of God has called my name.
</section>
<section>
So I will rise, and in the air
Behold the glory of the King.
I will not fear to meet him there.
I know my life is hid with him.
(Repeat)
