<h3>RCM 413: I Will Sing, O My Lord</h3>
I will sing, O my Lord, of Your mercy.
I will sing of Your love and faithfulness
Of Your death on the cross
for my sickness and pain,
For my sins, for my grief and shame.
</section>
<section>
I was lost, O my Lord, but You found me,
You chose me to be Your precious child.
I will sing of Your love,
I will praise Your name forever,
O my Saviour, I will sing Your praise.

<h3>RCM 294: Worthy The Lamb</h3>
And I beheld and I heard
the voice of many angels,
Round about the throne,
and the beasts and the elders.
</section>
<section>
And the number of them
was ten thousand times ten thousand,
and thousands and thousands,
saying with a loud voice:
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Blessing and honour and glory and power
Be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne
And unto the Lamb forever and ever!
Worthy the Lamb that was slain.

<h3>PP 43: My Heart Is Filled</h3>
1. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who bore my pain;
Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace
and gave me life again;
</section>
<section>
Who crushed my curse of sinfulness,
and clothed me in His light,
and wrote His law of righteousness
with power upon my heart.
</section>
<section>
2. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who walks beside;
Who floods my weaknesses with strength
and causes fear to fly;
</section>
<section>
Whose every promise is enough
for every step I take;
sustaining me with arms of love
and crowning me with grace.
</section>
<section>
3. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who reigns above;
Whose wisdom is my perfect peace,
Whose every thought is love.
</section>
<section>
For every day I have on earth
is given by the King.
So I will give my life, my all,
to love and follow Him.
