<h1>Crown Him With Many Crowns</h1>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
</section>
<section>
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
</section>
<section>
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side --
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
</section>
<section>
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace --
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
</section>
<section>
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
</section>
<section>
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!
