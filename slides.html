<h3>Rej 382: Come Thou Fount</h3>
1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
mount of Thy redeeming love.
</section>
<section>
2. Here I raise my Ebenezer,
hither by thy help I've come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
interposed His precious blood.
</section>
<section>
3. Oh, to grace how great a debtor
daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wandering heart to Thee:
prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here's my heart, O take and seal it;
seal it for thy courts above.

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
(Repeat)

<h3>Rej 207: There Is a Fountain, Filled with Blood</h3>
1. There is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from Emmanuel's veins,
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains;
lose all their guilty stains;
lose all their guilty stains;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
</section>
<section>
2. The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
and there have I, as vile as he,
washed all my sins away;
washed all my sins away;
washed all my sins away;
and there have I, as vile as he,
washed all my sins away.
</section>
<section>
3. O Lamb of God, Your precious blood
shall never lose its power,
till all the ransomed church of God
is saved, to sin no more;
is saved, to sin no more;
is saved, to sin no more;
till all the ransomed church of God
is saved, to sin no more.
</section>
<section>
4. And since, by faith, I saw the stream
Your flowing wounds supply,
redeeming love has been my theme,
and shall be till I die;
and shall be till I die;
and shall be till I die;
redeeming love has been my theme,
and shall be till I die.
</section>
<section>
5. When this poor lisping stammering tongue
lies silent in the grave,
then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Your power to save;
I'll sing Your power to save;
I'll sing Your power to save;
then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Your power to save.
