<h3>PP 6: From the Squalor</h3>
1. From the squalor of a borrowed stable,
by the Spirit and a virgin's faith,
to the anguish and the pain of scandal,
came the Saviour of the human race!
</section>
<section>
But the skies were filled
with the praise of heaven,
shepherds listen as the angels tell
of the gift of God come down to man
at the dawning of Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
2. King of heaven now the Friend of sinners,
Humble servant in the Father's hands,
Filled with power and the Holy Spirit,
Filled with mercy for the broken man.
</section>
<section>
Yes, He walked my road and He felt my pain,
Joys and sorrows that I know so well;
Yes His righteous steps give me hope again -
I will follow my Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
3. Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal,
He was lifted on a cruel cross;
He was punished for a world's transgressions,
He was suffering to save the lost.
</section>
<section>
He fights for breath, He fights for me,
Loosing sinners from the claims of hell,
And with a shout our souls are free -
Death defeated by Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
4. Now He's standing in the place of honour,
Crowned with glory on the highest throne,
Interceding for own beloved
Till His Father calls to bring them home!
</section>
<section>
Then the skies will part as the trumpet sounds
Hope of heaven or the fear of hell,
But the Bride will run to her Lover's arms,
Giving glory to Immanuel!
