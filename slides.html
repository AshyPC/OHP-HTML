<h3>Rej 92: Glory Be to God the Father</h3>
1. Glory be to God the Father,
glory be to God the Son,
glory be to God the Spirit,
great Jehovah, Three in One!
Glory, glory, glory, glory,
while eternal ages run!
</section>
<section>
2. Glory be to Him who loved us,
washed us from each spot and stain;
glory be to Him who bought us,
made us kings with Him to reign!
Glory, glory, glory, glory,
to the Lamb that once was slain!
</section>
<section>
3. Glory to the King of angels,
glory to the church's King;
glory to the King of nations;
heaven and earth, your praises bring.
Glory, glory, glory, glory,
to the King of Glory bring!
</section>
<section>
4. Glory, blessing, praise eternal!
Thus the choir of angels sings;
Honour, riches, power, dominion!
Thus its praise creation brings.
Glory, glory, glory, glory,
glory to the King of kings!

<h3>PP 10: I Will Glory in My Redeemer</h3>
1. I will glory in my Redeemer
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me -
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
And hung Him on that judgment tree.
</section>
<section>
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who crushed the power of sin and death,
My only Savior before the holy Judge,
The Lamb who is my righteousness,
The Lamb who is my righteousness.
</section>
<section>
2. I will glory in my Redeemer -
My life He bought, my love He owns.
I have no longings for another;
I’m satisfied in Him alone.
</section>
<section>
I will glory in my Redeemer,
His faithfulness my standing place.
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me,
My feet are firm, held by His grace,
My feet are firm, held by His grace.
</section>
<section>
3. I will glory in my Redeemer
Who carries me on eagles’ wings.
He crowns my life with lovingkindness;
His triumph song I’ll ever sing.
</section>
<section>
I will glory in my Redeemer,
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold.
</section>

I will glory in my Redeemer,
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold,
His face forever to behold.

<h3>MP 624: Take My Life and Let It Be</h3>
1. Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
</section>
<section>
2. Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.
</section>
<section>
3. Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.
</section>
<section>
4. Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.
</section>
<section>
5. Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart; it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne.
</section>
<section>
6. Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure-store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.

<h3>PP 39: This Life I Live</h3>
1. This life I live is not my own,
For my Redeemer paid the price.
He took it to be his alone,
To be his treasure and his prize.
</section>
<section>
The things of earth I leave behind
To live in worship of my King.
His is the right to rule my life,
Mine is the joy to live for him.
</section>
<section>
2. I died to sin upon the cross.
I'm bound to Jesus in his death.
The old is gone, and now I must
Rely on him for every breath.
</section>
<section>
With every footstep that I tread,
What mysteries He has in store.
I cannot know what lies ahead,
But know that he has gone before.
</section>
<section>
3. There is a voice that pierced the grave,
A power that rolled the stone away.
A sound of life, I know I'm saved,
The voice of God has called my name.
</section>
<section>
So I will rise, and in the air
Behold the glory of the King.
I will not fear to meet him there.
I know my life is hid with him.
(Repeat)
