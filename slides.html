<h3>Rej 8: Come Sing Praises</h3>
1. Come, sing praises to the Lord above,
Rock of our salvation, God of love;
to His presence with thanksgiving move
for the Lord our God is King!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
He's the King above the mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
subterranean depths that man defy
are in the hollow of His hand.
</section>
<section>
2. Here we worship Him and bow the knee
for the shepherd of the flock is He.
Mindful of His generosity,
sing the praise of FGod the King.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
He's the King above the mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
subterranean depths that man defy
are in the hollow of His hand.
</section>
<section>
3. Hear a salutary story now,
you with stubborn hearts who will not bow,
mind His people that rebelled, and how
He showed them He was their King!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
He's the King above the mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
subterranean depths that man defy
are in the hollow of His hand.
</section>
<section>
4. Forty years He kept their prize away,
made them wander till they walked His way,
exiled all of them until the day
they should honour Him as king.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
He's the King above the mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
subterranean depths that man defy
are in the hollow of His hand.

<h3>MP 236: Holy Child</h3>
1. Holy child, how still You lie!
safe the manger, soft the hay;
faint upon the eastern sky
breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
</section>
<section>
2. Holy child, Whose birthday brings
shepherds from their field and fold,
angel choirs and eastern kings,
myrrh and frankincense and gold;
</section>
<section>
3. Holy child, what gift of grace
from the Father freely willed!
In Your infant form we trace
all God's promises fulfilled.
</section>
<section>
4. Holy child, whose human years
span like ours delight and pain;
one in human joys and tears,
one in all but sin and stain
</section>
<section>
5. Holy child, so far from home,
all the lost to seek and save,
to what dreadful death You come,
to what dark and silent grave!
</section>
<section>
6. Holy child, before Whose Name
powers of darkness faint and fall;
conquered death and sin and shame -
Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
</section>
<section>
7. Holy child, how still You lie!
safe the manger, soft the hay;
clear upon the eastern sky
breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
