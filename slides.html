<h3>Rej 158: I Love to Tell the Story</h3>
1. I love to tell the story
of unseen things above,
of Jesus and His glory,
of Jesus and His love;
</section>
<section>
I love to tell the story,
the story ever true,
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I love to tell the story!
My theme will be in glory:
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and His love.
</section>
<section>
2. I love to tell the story --
how pleasant to repeat!
It seems, each time I tell it,
more wonderfully sweet;
</section>
<section>
I love to tell the story,
for some have never heard
the message of salvation
from God's own holy Word.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I love to tell the story!
My theme will be in glory:
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and His love.
</section>
<section>
3. I love to tell the story
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it like the rest.
</section>
<section>
And when in scenes of glory
I sing the new, new song,
I'll tell the old, old story
that I have loved so long.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I love to tell the story!
My theme will be in glory:
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and His love.

<h3>Rej 522: I Will Sing the Wondrous Story</h3>
1. I will sing the wondrous story
of the Christ who died for me,
how He left the realms of glory
for the Cross on Calvary.
</section>
<section>
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
of the Christ who died for me;
sing it with His saints in glory,
gathered by the crystal sea.
</section>
<section>
2. I was lost, but Jesus found me,
found the sheep that went astray,
took me up and gently led me
back into the narrow way.
</section>
<section>
Faint was I, and fears possessed me,
bruised was I from many a fall;
hope was gone, and shame distressed me:
but His love has pardoned all.
</section>
<section>
3. Days of darkness still may meet me,
sorrow's paths I often tread;
but the Saviour still is with me,
by His hand I'm safely led.
</section>
<section>
He will keep me till the river
rolls its waters at my feet;
then He'll bear me safely over,
made by grace for glory meet.
