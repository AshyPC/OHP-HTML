<h3>Rej 1: Rejoice, the Lord Is King!</h3>
1. Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore,
mortals, give thanks and sing,
and triumph evermore!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
2. Jesus the Saviour reigns,
the God of truth and love
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>

3. His Kingdom cannot fail!
He rules both earth and heaven
The keys of death and hell
To Jesus now are given.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>

4. He sits at God's right hand,
till all His foes submit
and bow to His command
and fall beneath His feet.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>

5. Rejoice in glorious hope,
Jesus the Judge shall come
and take His servants up
to their eternal home!

<i>We soon shall hear the archangel's voice,
the trumpet's sound: Rejoice! Rejoice!</i>

<h3>Rej 582: My Hope Is Built</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus' Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
2. When weary in this earthly race,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
in every wild and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
3. His oath, His covenant and blood
are my defence against the flood;
when earthly hopes are swept away
He will uphold me on that day.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
O may I still in Him be found!
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before His throne.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.

<h3>Rej 382: Come Thou Fount</h3>
1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
mount of Thy redeeming love.
</section>
<section>
2. Here I raise my Ebenezer,
hither by thy help I've come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
interposed His precious blood.
</section>
<section>
3. Oh, to grace how great a debtor
daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wandering heart to Thee:
prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here's my heart, O take and seal it;
seal it for thy courts above.

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
(Repeat)
