<h3>Rej 1: Rejoice, the Lord Is King!</h3>
1. Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore,
mortals, give thanks and sing,
and triumph evermore!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
2. Jesus the Saviour reigns,
the God of truth and love
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
3. His Kingdom cannot fail!
He rules both earth and heaven
The keys of death and hell
To Jesus now are given.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
4. He sits at God's right hand,
till all His foes submit
and bow to His command
and fall beneath His feet.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>

5. Rejoice in glorious hope,
Jesus the Judge shall come
and take His servants up
to their eternal home!

<i>We soon shall hear the archangel's voice,
the trumpet's sound: Rejoice! Rejoice!</i>

<h3>Rej 254: Jesus Comes With Clouds Descending</h3>
1. Jesus comes with clouds descending,
see the Lamb for sinners slain!
Thousand thousand saints attending
join to sing the glad refrain:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
God appears on earth to reign.

2. Every eye shall then behold Him
robed in awesome majesty;
those who jeered at Him and sold Him,
pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
shamed and grieving, shamed and grieving,
shamed and grieving,
shall their true Messiah see.
</section>
<section>
3. Now redemption, long expected,
see in majesty appear;
all His saints by man rejected
now shall meet Him in the air.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
See the day of God appear.
</section>
<section>
4. Lord, amen! Let all adore You
high on Your eternal throne;
crowns and empires fall before You:
claim the Kingdom for Your own.
Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!
Everlasting God, come down.
