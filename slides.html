<h3>RCM 373: Gathering Before Our Precious Saviour</h3>
Gathering before our precious Saviour,
Revealing Christ as Lord and King of all
Called, appointed, and anointed,
To proclaim His rise and Babylon's great fall!

Jesus, He shall reign forever,
enthroned on high, our mighty Prince of Peace.
Come, let's sing to Him forever,
One unto His holy name.

Praise Him, exalt Him, Jesus Christ forever
Lord God of glory,

Come let's sing to Him forever
In one accord.

<section>
Yes, we are His chosen people,
From darkness He has brought us into light
Marching on together in victory
Proclaiming high His name in every fight.

No, not one can stand against us,
for our weapons are of God and not of men
Lo, look high our Saviour cometh
As He wields His sword across the land!

Praise Him, exalt Him, Jesus Christ forever
Lord God of glory,
Yes, He's brighter than the Morning Star!

Come let's sing to Him forever,
Come let's sing to Him forever,
In one accord!

<h3>MP 308: Be Exalted, O God</h3>
I will give thanks to Thee,
O Lord, among the people
I will sing praises to Thee
Among the nations.
For Thy steadfast love is great,
Is great to the heavens,
And Thy faithfulness,
Thy faithfulness, to the clouds!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens
Let Thy glory be over all the earth.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens
Let Thy glory be over all the earth.

<h3>RCM 248: That's What I Have, That's Who I Am</h3>
Blessings and more blessings overtake me,
All His commandments I observe
While my soul doth prosper in the knowledge
Of Jesus Christ, my Lord, the Living Word.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
That's what I have, that's who I am
I'm a king come out of Abraham.
Because of Christ, I reign in life in Him
That's what I have, that's who I am!
</section>
<section>
Blest have I been in the city,
Blest have I been in the field,
The Lord has commanded on me blessing
It's my Father's pleasure and His will.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
That's what I have, that's who I am
I'm a king come out of Abraham.
Because of Christ, I reign in life in Him
That's what I have, that's who I am!
</section>
<section>
He blesses everything I set my hand to
My enemies run from me seven ways
The Lord has opened to me His good treasure
While I observe to do what Jesus says.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
That's what I have, that's who I am
I'm a king come out of Abraham.
Because of Christ, I reign in life in Him
That's what I have, that's who I am!
