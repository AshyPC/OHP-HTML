<h3>PP 37: 10,000 Reasons</h3>
<i>Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.</i>
</section>
<section>
1. The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
It's time to sing your song again.
Whatever may pass,
And whatever lies before me,
Let me be singing when the evening comes.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
</section>
<section>
2. You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
Your name is great and your heart is kind.
For all your goodness, I will keep on singing;
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
</section>
<section>
3. And on that day, when my strength is failing,
The end draws near, and my time has come;
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.

<h3>Rej 150: We Greet You, Sure Redeemer</h3>

reigning omnipotent in every place:
so come, O King, and our whole being sway;
shine on us with the light of Your pure day.

You have no harshness and no bitterness:

Responding to the Kingdom</h1>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3><u>1. Abner – opposing the kingdom.</u></h3>
Abner thought the best future was in a rival kingdom. 
&emsp; A kingdom tied to the family of Saul. 
&emsp; A kingdom where he could exert his influence.
</section>
<section class="black" data-bg="RespondingToTheKingdom2.png">
</section>
<section class=smaller>
Abner opposed the Lord’s ‘messiah’.
We do too when:
<ul><li>we think the Kingdom can be ours by our own efforts;</li>
<li>we know what Jesus says but fail to live it out;</li>
<li>fail to submit our lives and desires to Jesus’ sovereign rule.</li></ul>
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<h3><u>2. Abner – seeking advantage from the kingdom.</u></h3>
<aside>2 Samuel 3:9-10
“May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the Lord promised him on oath and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David’s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.”</aside>
<aside>2 Samuel 3:12 
Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, “Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you.”</aside>
</section>
<section class=smaller>
Like Abner, do we sometimes seek the Kingdom for our own advantage?
Are there times when we turn to Jesus only because of what we want from Him?
How easy it is to shift the ‘balance’ in our understanding of the gospel to make it ‘about us.’
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<h3><u>3. Joab – subverting the kingdom.</u></h3>
Joab is also acting for his own glory. 
<blockquote>The murder of Abner is partly about revenge, but probably also about removing a rival for fear of losing his position as commander (see also 2 Samuel 20).</blockquote>
<aside>To what extent are our motives pure as we serve our King?
<blockquote>It is easy for pride to rise in our hearts, to desire power or the praise of others, and make serving Jesus about US.</blockquote></aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
John Woodhouse commented: “Some sought to hasten it. Some sought to defeat it. Some sought to turn the kingdom to their own advantage. But none of them was good enough, wise enough, or powerful enough to accomplish what they intended.”
The Kingdom may only be attained at the invitation of the King and in the grace that He gives.
</section>
<section class=smaller>
The Kingdom can never be twisted to our own advantage; in fact:
<ul>
<li>it is our desire for own advantage that we surrender to enter it;</li>
<li>it is desire for own glory that we swap to bask in Jesus’s glory;</li>
<li>it is building our own kingdom that we give up to seek His Kingdom;</li>
<li>it is things that corrode, decay, waste away &amp; disappoint, that we
swap for eternal weight of glory &amp; life with the King Himself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rej 582: My Hope Is Built</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus' Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
2. When weary in this earthly race,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
in every wild and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
3. His oath, His covenant and blood
are my defence against the flood;
when earthly hopes are swept away
He will uphold me on that day.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
O may I still in Him be found!
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before His throne.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
