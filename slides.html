<h3>Rej 1: Rejoice, the Lord Is King!</h3>
1. Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore,
mortals, give thanks and sing,
and triumph evermore!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
2. Jesus the Saviour reigns,
the God of truth and love
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
3. His Kingdom cannot fail!
He rules both earth and heaven
The keys of death and hell
To Jesus now are given.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
4. He sits at God's right hand,
till all His foes submit
and bow to His command
and fall beneath His feet.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>

5. Rejoice in glorious hope,
Jesus the Judge shall come
and take His servants up
to their eternal home!

<i>We soon shall hear the archangel's voice,
the trumpet's sound: Rejoice! Rejoice!</i>

<h3>Rej 582: My Hope Is Built</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus' Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
2. When weary in this earthly race,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
in every wild and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
3. His oath, His covenant and blood
are my defence against the flood;
when earthly hopes are swept away
He will uphold me on that day.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
O may I still in Him be found!
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before His throne.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.

<h3>MP 975: Before the Throne of God Above</h3>
1. Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
a great High Priest, whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
</section>
<section>
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
</section>
<section>
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
who made an end of all my sin.
</section>
<section>
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.
</section>
<section>
3. Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
</section>
<section>
One with Himself, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.

<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
(Repeat)
