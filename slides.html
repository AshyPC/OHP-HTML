<h3>PP 7: How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
1. How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure;
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
</section>
<section>
How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Behold the man upon a Cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
</section>
<section>
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished,
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
</section>
<section>
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
(Repeat)
