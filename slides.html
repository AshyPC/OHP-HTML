<h3>Rej 246: Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side -
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace -
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!

<h3>PP 46: Jerusalem</h3>
1. See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are.
Once these streets had sung to Him;
Now they cry for murder.
</section>
<section>
Such a frail and lonely Man
Holding up the heavy cross -
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us.
</section>
<section>
2. See Him there upon the hill;
Hear the scorn and laughter.
Silent as a lamb He waits,
Praying to the Father.
</section>
<section>
See the King who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down
So that He could save them.
</section>
<section>
3. See Him there upon the cross,
Now no longer breathing.
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section>
Feel the earth is shaking now!
See the veil is split in two!
And He stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with His blood.
</section>
<section>
4. See the empty tomb today -
Death could not contain Him!
Once the Servant of the world
Now in vict'ry reigning!
</section>
<section>
Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne!
See Him in the New Jerusalem -
Praise the One who saved us!

before Him prostrate fall,
and shout in universal song:
'We crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
crown Him Lord of all.'

join in the everlasting song,
and crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
crown Him Lord of all.
