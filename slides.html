<h3>O Worship The King, All Glorious Above</h3>
1. O worship the King all glorious above,
and gratefully sing His power and His love;
our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise.
</section>
<section>
2. O tell of His might and sing of His grace,
whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
</section>
<section>
3. The earth, with its store of wonders untold,
Almighty, Your power has founded of old;
established it fast by Your changeless decree,
and round it has cast like a mantle the sea.
</section>
<section>
4. Your bountiful care what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.
</section>
<section>
5. We children of dust are feeble and frail:
in You we will trust, for You never fail;
Your mercies are tender, and firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.
</section>
<section>
6. O measureless Might, unchangeable Love,
whom angels delight to worship above!
Your ransomed creation with glory ablaze,
in true adoration shall sing to Your praise!

<h3>My Soul Finds Rest (Psalm 62)</h3>
1. My soul finds rest in God alone,
My rock and my salvation.
A fortress strong against my foes,
and I will not be shaken.
Though lips may bless and hearts may curse,
and lies like arrows pierce me
I'll fix my heart on righteousness,
I'll look to him who hears me.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.
</section>
<section>
2. Find rest, my soul in God alone,
amid the world's temptations.
When evil seeks to take a hold,
I'll cling to my salvation.
Though riches come and riches go,
don't set your heart upon them.
The fields of hope in which I sow
are harvested in heaven.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.
</section>
<section>
3. I'll set my gaze on God alone,
and trust in Him completely,
With every day pour out my soul
and He will prove His mercy.
Though life is but a fleeting breath,
a sigh too brief to measure,
My King has crushed the curse of death
and I am His forever.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.

<h3>Forever with the Lord</h3>
1. Forever with the Lord!
Amen, so let it be;
life from the dead is in that word
of immortality.
Here in the body pent,
absent from Him I roam,
yet nightly pitch my moving tent
a day's march nearer home.
</section>
<section>
2. My Father's house on high,
home of my soul, how near.
At times, to faith's foreseeing eye,
your golden gates appear!
And then my spirit faints
to reach the land I love,
the bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.
</section>
<section>
3. Forever with the Lord!
According to Your will,
the promise of that faithful word,
Lord, here to me fulfil.
Lord be at my right hand,
then I shall never fail;
uphold me, Lord, and I shall stand;
fight, and I must prevail.
</section>
<section>
4. So, when my latest breath
shall end all earthly pain,
by death I shall escape from death,
and life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
how shall I love that word,
and oft repeat before the throne:
'Forever with the Lord!'
