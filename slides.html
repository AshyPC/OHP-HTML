<h3>Rej 576: Loved with Everlasting Love</h3>
1. Loved with everlasting love,
led by grace that love to know;
Spirit breathing from above,
You have taught me it is so:
</section>
<section>
O what full and perfect peace,
joy and wonder all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His and He is mine;
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His and He is mine.
</section>

2. Heaven above is softer blue,
earth around is richer green;
something lives in every hue,
Christless eyes have never seen:
</section>
<section>
Songs of birds in sweetness grow,
flowers with deeper beauties shine,
since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine;
since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine.
</section>
<section>
3. His forever, His alone!
Who the Lord from me shall part?
With what joy and peace unknown
Christ can fill the loving heart!
</section>
<section>
Heaven and earth may pass away,
sun and stars in gloom decline,
but of Christ I still shall say:
I am His and He is mine.
But of Christ I still shall say:
I am His and He is mine.

For I'm building a people of power,
and I'm making a people of praise,
that will move through this land by My Spirit,
and wiill glorify My precious name.

Build Your church, Lord, make us strong, Lord,
Join our hearts, Lord, through Your Son;
Make us one, Lord, in your body,
in the Kingdom of Your Son.
