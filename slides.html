<h3>O Worship The King, All Glorious Above</h3>
1. O worship the King all glorious above,
and gratefully sing His power and His love;
our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise.
</section>
<section>
2. O tell of His might and sing of His grace,
whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
</section>
<section>
3. The earth, with its store of wonders untold,
Almighty, Your power has founded of old;
established it fast by Your changeless decree,
and round it has cast like a mantle the sea.
</section>
<section>
4. Your bountiful care what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.
</section>
<section>
5. We children of dust are feeble and frail:
in You we will trust, for You never fail;
Your mercies are tender, and firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.
</section>
<section>
6. O measureless Might, unchangeable Love,
whom angels delight to worship above!
Your ransomed creation with glory ablaze,
in true adoration shall sing to Your praise!

<h3>Through the Love of God Our Saviour</h3>
1. Through the love of God our Saviour 
all will be well.
Free and changeless is His favour, 
all, all is well.
</section>
<section>
Precious is the blood that healed us;
perfect is the grace that sealed us;
strong the hand stretched forth to shield us; 
all must be well.
</section>
<section>
2. Though we pass through tribulation, 
all will be well.
Christ has purchased full salvation, 
all, all is well.
</section>
<section>
Happy still in God confiding,
fruitful if in Christ abiding,
holy through the Spirit's guiding; 
all must be well.
</section>
<section>
3. We expect a bright tomorrow; 
all will be well.
Faith can sing through days of sorrow: 
all, all is well.
</section>
<section>
On our Father's love relying,
Jesus every need supplying,
then in living or in dying 
all must be well.

<h3>God Has Spoken By His Prophets</h3>
1. God has spoken by His prophets,
spoken His unchanging Word;
each from age to age proclaiming
God the One, the righteous Lord;
</section>
<section>
in the world's despair and turmoil
one firm anchor still holds fast:
God is King, His throne eternal,
God the first and God the last.
</section>
<section>
2. God has spoken by Christ Jesus,
Christ, the everlasting Son;
brightness of the Father's glory,
with the Father ever one:
</section>
<section>
spoken by the Word incarnate,
God, before all time began,
Light of light, to earth descending,
Man, revealing God to man.
</section>
<section>
3. God is speaking by His Spirit
speaking to the hearts of men;
in the age-long Word expounding
God's own message, now as then.
</section>
<section>
Through the rise and fall of nations
one sure faith is standing fast:
God abides, His Word unchanging,
God the first and God the last.

<h3>I am Carried</h3>
1. Day by day and hour by hour,
Your love for me from heaven flows
Like streams of water in the desert
living waters flow.
</section>
<section>
You walk beside me, gently guiding,
Leading me through every storm.
Ever lasting, never changing,
grace and love divine.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
I am held by hands of healing,
Washed by water pure.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Lifting up my heavy heart,
Held in grace-scarred hands.
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
</section>
<section>
2. Mercy's healing grace relieving
Every spot and every stain.
forgiven freely, no more guilty,
Love has conquered shame.
</section>
<section>
The broken mended, night has ended,
Lost and lonely, lost no more,
For I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
I am held by hands of healing,
Washed by water pure.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Lifting up my heavy heart,
Held in grace-scarred hands.
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
</section>
<section>
3. Never worthy, never earning,
All my works now left behind.
Ever onwards, ever upwards,
You've called me on to rise.
</section>
<section>
Above my darkness, all my failure,
Every fear and every pain -
Always carried, always covered
by grace and love divine.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
I am held by hands of healing,
Washed by water pure.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Lifting up my heavy heart,
Held in grace-scarred hands.
I am carried in the arms
of grace and love divine.
