<h3>Rej 296: Church of God, Elect and Glorious</h3>
1. Church of God, elect and glorious,
holy nation, chosen race;
called as God's own special people,
royal priests and heirs of grace:
</section>
<section>
know the purpose of your calling,
show to all His mighty deeds;
tell of love which knows no limits,
grace which meets all human needs.
</section>
<section>
2. God has called you out of darkness
into His most marvellous light;
brought His truth of life within you,
turned your blindness into sight.
</section>
<section>
Let your light so shine around you
that God's Name is glorified;
and all find fresh hope and purpose
in Christ Jesus crucified.
</section>
<section>
3. Once you were an alien people,
strangers to God's heart of love;
but He brought you home in mercy,
citizens of heaven above.
</section>
<section>
Let His love flow out to others,
let them feel a Father's care;
that they too may know His welcome
and His countless blessings share.
</section>
<section>
4. Church of God, elect and holy,
be the people He intends;
strong in faith and swift to answer
each command Your Master sends:
</section>
<section>
royal priests, fulfil your calling
through your sacrifice and prayer;
give your lives in joyful service -
sing His praise, His love declare.

<h3>Rej 456: Who is on the Lord's Side</h3>
1. Who is on the Lord's side,
who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers
other lives to bring?
</section>
<section>
Who will leave the world's side?
Who will face the foe?
Who is on the Lord's side,
who for Him will go?
</section>
<section>
By His call of mercy,
by His sovereign grace,
we are His own people,
His own royal race.
</section>
<section>
2. Jesus, You have bought us,
not with gold or gem,
but with Your own life-blood,
for Your diadem.
</section>
<section>
With Your blessing filling
all who come to You,
You have made us willing
You have made us true.
</section>
<section>
By Your grand redemption,
by Your sovereign grace,
we are Your own people,
Your own royal race.
</section>
<section>
3. Fierce may be the conflict,
strong may be the foe,
but the King's own army
none can overthrow.
</section>
<section>
Round His standard ranging,
victory is secure,
for His truth unchanging
makes the triumph sure.
</section>
<section>
By Your call of mercy,
by Your sovereign grace,
we are Your own people,
Your own royal race.
</section>
<section>
4. Chosen to be soldiers
in an alien land,
chosen, called, and faithful,
for our Captain's band,
</section>
<section>
in the service royal
let us not grow cold;
let us be right loyal,
noble, true, and bold.
</section>
<section>
Master, You will keep us,
by Your sovereign grace,
always Your own people,
Your own royal race.
