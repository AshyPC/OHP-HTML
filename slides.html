<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

You stepped down into darkness,
opened my eyes, let me see.
Beauty that made this heart adore You,
hope of a life spent with You.

altogether wonderful to me.

<h3>Rej 243: Lord Enthroned in Heavenly Splendour</h3>
1. Lord, enthroned in heavenly splendour,
glorious first-born from the dead,
You alone our strong defender
lifting up Your people's head:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus, true and living bread!

2. Prince of life, for us now living,
by Your body souls are healed;
Prince of peace, Your pardon giving,
by Your blood our peace is sealed:

Word of God in flesh revealed.

3. Paschal Lamb! Your offering finished,
once for all, when You were slain;

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Cleansing souls from every stain.

4. Great High Priest of our profession,
through the veil You entered in,
by Your mighty intercession
grace and mercy there to win:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Only sacrifice for sin.
</section>

5. Life-imparting heavenly manna,
stricken rock, with streaming side;
heaven and earth, with loud hosanna,
worship You, the Lamb who died:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Risen, ascended, glorified!

The ark…
<ol><li>was a visual reminder of God’s presence with them</li>
<li>represented the covenant between God and Israel</li>
<li>was at the heart of worship and spoke of God’s mercy and His laws</li></ol>

<h3>1. How God comes</h3>
<aside>If Israel is to be the Lord’s people, the ark (representing God’s presence) must be at the centre of their existence.

<blockquote>2 Samuel 6:1–2
David again brought together out of Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all. He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the name of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark.</blockquote>
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>a) God is not safe</h3>
<blockquote>2 Samuel 6:7
The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God.</blockquote>
<aside><blockquote>2 Samuel 6:8 
Then David was angry because the Lord’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.</blockquote>
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>b) God is holy</h3>
The problem is they decided to carry the ark around in the same way the Philistines had, ignoring God’s instructions.
<blockquote>Numbers 4:15 
“After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die.”</blockquote>
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<blockquote>2 Samuel 6:9 
David was afraid of the Lord that day and said, “How can the ark of the Lord ever come to me?”</blockquote>
<aside>
Perhaps, like David, we want God at the centre of our lives, but we try to do it on our terms.

Our hearts may twist even the things of God to make them about us.

God is not safe, but He is holy, and He is good.
</aside>
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<h3>c) God’s presence is blessing</h3>
<blockquote>2 Samuel 6:11  
The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord blessed him and his entire household.</blockquote>

<aside>God does not confront David’s attitude, but in love and patience he woos him back to Himself.</aside>

<aside>In the cross of Jesus, we see the extraordinary lengths to which God will go.</aside>

<h3>2. Responding to God’s presence</h3>
a) with humility and rejoicing

David makes sacrifices – we can only draw near to God through a sacrifice for our sin.

David humbles himself, laying aside his royal robes.

David worships with unrestrained joy!
</section>
<section class=black>
b) with dignity and misery

Michal stands in contrast. She despised David.

For her, the kingship is about dignity and demanding respect.

But standing on our own dignity will always block the way to God.
</section>
<section class=black>
Chapter 6 is about having the right foundation

It is about God’s presence at the centre of everything

It is about God’s grace that makes it possible, even when our own hearts would give up

And it is about our absolute JOY in worship when He is at the centre

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might,
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward,
O Power of my power.

<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only be first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, when victory is won,
May I reach heaven's joys,
O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
