<h3>Rej 330: God Himself is Present</h3>
1. God Himself is present: 
let us now adore Him
and with awe appear before Him.
God is in His temple, 
all within keep silence,
prostrate lie with deepest reverence.
Him alone God we own.
Him our God and Saviour: 
praise His Name forever.
</section>
<section>
2. God Himself is present: 
hear the harps resounding,
see the crowds His throne surrounding.
Holy, holy, holy, 
hear the hymn ascending,
Saints' and angels' voices blending.
Bow Your ear to us here.
Hear O Lord the praises 
that Your church now raises.
</section>
<section>
3. Lord, the Fount of Blessing, 
purify my spirit,
trusting only in Your merit.
Like the holy angels 
who behold Your glory,
may I ceaselessly adore You.
Lord, Your will to fulfil
be my one endeavour 
now, henceforth, forever.

<h3>PP 33: Calvary</h3>
You exchanged my curses for blessings
And traded my sickness for health;
You removed my guilt with forgiveness
And supply all my needs from Your wealth;
For my hatred you've given Your perfect love
And peace in place of my strife,
You have given me faith instead of doubt,
The death that You died gave me life.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Calvary! We're set free!
By His blood we have been redeemed!
Calvary! Liberty!
He has conquered! We have victory!

<h3>Rej 108: A Sovereign Protector I Have</h3>
1. A Sovereign Protector I have,
unseen, yet forever at hand,
unchangeably faithful to save,
almighty to rule and command.
</section>
<section>
2. He smiles, and my comforts abound;
His grace as the dew shall descend;
and walls of salvation surround
the soul He delights to defend.
</section>
<section>
3. Inspirer and hearer of prayer,
great Shepherd and Guardian of Souls,
my all to Your covenant care
I sleeping and waking resign.
</section>
<section>
4. With You as my Shield and my Sun,
the night is not darkness to me;
and fast as my moments roll on,
they bring me Your glory to see.
</section>
<section>
5. Kind Author and Ground of my hope,
You, Lord, for my God I avow;
my glad testimony proclaim,
that You, Lord, have helped me till now.
</section>
<section>
6. I think on the years that are past,
wherein my defence You have proved;
nor will You relinquish at last
a sinner so greatly beloved!

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
