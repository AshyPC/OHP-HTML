<h3>Rej 380: Marvellous Grace of Our</h3>
<h3>Loving Lord</h3>
1. Marvellous grace of our loving Lord,
grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
Yonder on Calvary's mount out-poured,
there where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!
</section>
<section>
2. Sin and despair, like the seawaves cold,
threaten the soul with infinite loss;
grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
points to the refuge, the mighty cross.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!
</section>
<section>
3. Dark is the stain that we cannot hide;
what can avail to wash it away?
Look: there is flowing a crimson tide --
whiter than snow you may be today.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!
</section>
<section>
4. Marvellous, infinite, matchless grace,
freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,
will you this moment His grace receive?
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
grace, grace, God's grace,
grace that is greater than all our sin!

<h3>PP 6: From the Squalor</h3>
1. From the squalor of a borrowed stable,
by the Spirit and a virgin's faith,
to the anguish and the pain of scandal,
came the Saviour of the human race!
</section>
<section>
But the skies were filled
with the praise of heaven,
shepherds listen as the angels tell
of the gift of God come down to man
at the dawning of Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
2. King of heaven now the Friend of sinners,
Humble servant in the Father's hands,
Filled with power and the Holy Spirit,
Filled with mercy for the broken man.
</section>
<section>
Yes, He walked my road and He felt my pain,
Joys and sorrows that I know so well;
Yes His righteous steps give me hope again -
I will follow my Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
3. Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal,
He was lifted on a cruel cross;
He was punished for a world's transgressions,
He was suffering to save the lost.
</section>
<section>
He fights for breath, He fights for me,
Loosing sinners from the claims of hell,
And with a shout our souls are free -
Death defeated by Immanuel.
</section>
<section>
4. Now He's standing in the place of honour,
Crowned with glory on the highest throne,
Interceding for own beloved
Till His Father calls to bring them home!
</section>
<section>
Then the skies will part as the trumpet sounds
Hope of heaven or the fear of hell,
But the Bride will run to her Lover's arms,
Giving glory to Immanuel!

<h3>Rej 586: It is well (When Peace Like a River)</h3>
1. When peace, like a river, 
flows all through my life,
when sorrows like sea billows roll;
whatever my lot, You have taught me to say:
It is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
2. Though Satan should buffet, 
though trials should come,
let this blest assurance control:
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate
and has shed His own blood for my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
4. My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought,
my sin, not in part, but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more:
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
5. And, Lord, haste the day when 
my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll:
the trumpet shall sound and the Lord shall descend,
'Even so' - it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.

<section><address>Job 1
page 374</address></section>
<section>
There are two ways to view suffering: one is from a
Christian point of view and the other is the
non-Christian point of view.
<aside>
As we look at Job’s story, the question can be raised if
this book is reliable because of questions on historical
facts in the story. If this man Job did not really exist and
this story is fiction, I believe that it cannot be suitable to
speak about suffering.
</aside>
</section>
<section>
<u>Suffering not always determined by sin</u>
<aside>
There are times where death and misfortune do occur
for the sins of an individual.

1. Eli (1 Samuel 2)
</aside>
<aside>
2. David (his son Absalom)
</aside>
<aside>
In modern times, there are some speakers around the
world who directly relate natural disaster as God’s
punishment for our sins
</aside>
<aside>
Not the case with Job. Job is complimented by God in
two aspects of his character
</aside>
</section>
<section>
Job 1:1 “In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name
was Job. This man was <u>blameless and upright</u>; he feared
God and shunned evil.”
<aside>
Job 1:1 “In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name
was Job. This man was blameless and upright; <u>he feared
God and shunned evil.</u>”
</aside>
<aside>
Job didn’t touch anything that would displease God
</aside>
<aside>
Job was wealthy
</aside>
</section>
<section>
Job 2-3 “He had <u>seven sons</u> and <u>three</u> daughters, and he
owned <u>seven</u> thousand sheep, <u>three</u> thousand camels,
<u>five</u> hundred yoke of oxen and <u>five</u> hundred donkeys,
and had a <u>large number of servants</u>. He was the greatest
man among all the people of the East.”
<aside>
Job 1:5 “When a period of feasting had run its course,
Job would make arrangements for them to be purified.
Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering
for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have
sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s
regular custom.”
</aside>
</section>
<section>
<u>God’s confidence in Job</u>
<aside>
Job 1:8 “Have you considered my servant Job? There is
no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a
man who fears God and shuns evil.”
</aside>
<aside>
The Satan is actually questioning whether Job’s faith is
legitimate
</aside>
<aside>
Job 1:11 “But now stretch out your hand and strike
everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your
face.”
</aside>
</section>
<section>
For most religious people, faith is about what you can
get out of it, rather than sincere love and devotion to
God, and knowing who he is and loving him for who he
is.
<aside>
Job 1:12 “Very well, then, everything he has is in your
power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”
</aside>
<aside>
God is very much in control of everything.
</aside>
</section>
<section>
The disasters that struck Job’s possessions and family
were of earthly and heavenly nature.


Earthly - Sabeans took the oxen and donkeys, and killed
the servants(v. 15); Chaldeans took camels and killed the
servants (v. 17)


Heavenly - Lightning struck sheep and servants (v. 16);
whirlwind killed Job’s children (v. 19)
</section>
<section>
Why did Job suffer?


John 9:1-5 “As he went along, he saw a man blind from
birth. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this
man or his parents, that he was born blind?”

<u>“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,”</u> said Jesus,
<u>“but this happened so that the works of God might be
displayed in him.</u> As long as it is day, we must do the
works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one
can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the
world.”
</section>
<section>
<u>God gives and takes away</u>
<aside>
Job is said to have “fell to the ground in worship.”
</aside>
<aside>
He showed full reverence and respect to God.
</aside>
<aside>
Job 1:20 “At this, Job got up and tore his robe and
shaved his head”
</aside>
<aside>
What Job remembered is where he came from
</aside>
<aside>
Job 1:21 “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and
naked I will depart.”
</aside>
</section>
<section>
When we are born we are introduced to the world with
nothing
<aside>
God’s creation of human beings.
</aside>
<aside>
Gen 2:7 “<u>Then the Lord God formed a man from the
dust of the ground</u> and breathed into his nostrils the
breath of life, and the man became a living being.”
</aside>
<aside>
Job is recognising the puniness of us as humans, and the
greatness of God.
</aside>
</section>
<section>
Job 1:21 “The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away;
may the name of the Lord be praised.”

It all belongs to God
<aside>
<u>No Blaming</u>
</aside>
<aside>
The words “curse” and “blame” is used in matters
directly related to God.
</aside>
<aside>
“he will surely curse you to your face.” (1:11; 2:5)
</aside>
<aside>
“Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.” (1:22)

“His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity?
Curse God and die!” He replied, “You are talking like a foolish[b]
woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?”” (Job
2:9-10)
</aside>
</section>
<section>
It is important to understand that blaming God is a sin
itself.
<aside>
There is nothing greater than having a relationship with
Christ
</aside>
<aside>
“But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the
sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss
because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus
my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider
them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the
law, but that which is through faith in Christ.” (Phil. 3:7-9)
</aside>
