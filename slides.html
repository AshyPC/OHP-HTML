<h3>MP 975: Before the Throne of God Above</h3>
1. Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
a great High Priest, whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
</section>
<section>
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
</section>
<section>
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
who made an end of all my sin.
</section>
<section>
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.
</section>
<section>
3. Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
</section>
<section>
One with Himself, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.

<h3>Rej 582: My Hope Is Built</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus' Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
2. When weary in this earthly race,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
in every wild and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
3. His oath, His covenant and blood
are my defence against the flood;
when earthly hopes are swept away
He will uphold me on that day.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
</section>
<section>
4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
O may I still in Him be found!
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before His throne.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.

<h3>PP 2: Behold The Lamb</h3>
1. Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
slain for us
and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of peace
around the table of the King.
</section>
<section>
2. The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
torn for you
eat and remember:
The wounds that heal,
the death that brings us life
paid the price to make us one.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of love
around the table of the King.
</section>
<section>
3. The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
shed for you
drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
to receive the life of God.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of grace
around the table of the King.
</section>
<section>
4. And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
to respond
and to remember
our call to follow in the steps of Christ
as His body here on earth.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
As we share
in His suffering,
we proclaim
Christ will come again!
And we'll join
in the feast of heaven
around the table of the King.
