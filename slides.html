<h3>Rej 316: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</h3>
1. A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing.
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing:

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.

2. Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing.

You ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He.
The Lord of Hosts, His Name -
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.

3. And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us.

The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
we know his doom is sure,
the Word of God shall fell him.

4. That Word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, is standing;
the Spirit and His gifts are ours -
we answer His commanding.

Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill,
God's truth is ruling still -
His kingdom is forever!
