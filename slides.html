<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

<h3>PP 47: Jesus Paid It All</h3>
1. I hear the Savior say,
thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
find in me thine all in all
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
he washed it white as snow
</section>
<section>
2. Lord, now indeed I find
thy power and thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
and melt the heart of stone
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
he washed it white as snow
</section>

3. And when before the throne
I stand in him complete
"Jesus died my soul to save"
my lips shall still repeat.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
he washed it white as snow

Sin had left a crimson stain,
he washed it white as snow
he washed it white as snow
he washed it white as snow
</section>
<section class=refrain>
O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
he washed it white as snow

Sin had left a crimson stain,
he washed it white as snow
he washed it white as snow
he washed it white as snow

<h3>Rej 243: Lord Enthroned in Heavenly Splendour</h3>
1. Lord, enthroned in heavenly splendour,
glorious first-born from the dead,
You alone our strong defender
lifting up Your people's head:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus, true and living bread!
</section>
<section>
2. Prince of life, for us now living,
by Your body souls are healed;
Prince of peace, Your pardon giving,
by Your blood our peace is sealed:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Word of God in flesh revealed.
</section>
<section>
3. Paschal Lamb! Your offering finished,
once for all, when You were slain;
in its fullness undiminished
shall forevermore remain:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Cleansing souls from every stain.
</section>
<section>
4. Great High Priest of our profession,
through the veil You entered in,
by Your mighty intercession
grace and mercy there to win:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Only sacrifice for sin.
</section>
<section>
5. Life-imparting heavenly manna,
stricken rock, with streaming side;
heaven and earth, with loud hosanna,
worship You, the Lamb who died:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Risen, ascended, glorified!
