1. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!
Early in the morning 
our song of praise shall be:
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, glorious Trinity.
</section>
<section>
2. Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore You,
casting down their golden crowns 
around the glassy sea.
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before You:
You were and are, and evermore shall be!
</section>
<section>
3. Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide You,
though the eye of sinful man 
Your glory may not see, 
You alone are holy, there is none beside You, 
perfect in pow'r, in love and purity.
</section>

4. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!
All Your works shall praise Your Name,
in earth and sky and sea:
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, glorious Trinity.

(My Hope is Built)</address></section>
<section>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

<section>
1. You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began;
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand.
</section>
<section>
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice;
Let the skies declare Your glory,
Let the land and seas rejoice!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation!
You're the Lord of ev'ry man!
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands.
</section>
<section>
2. Yet You left the gaze of angels,
Came to seek and save the lost,
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross.
</section>
<section>
With a prayer You fed the hungry;
With a word You stilled the sea;
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation!
You're the Lord of ev'ry man!
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands.
</section>
<section>
3. With a shout You rose victorious,
Wresting victory from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your wake.
</section>
<section>
Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own;
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation!
You're the Lord of ev'ry man!
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands.

<section><address>Lord Be My Vision</address></section>
<section>
1. Lord, be my vision, supreme in my heart,
bid every rival give way and depart:
You my best thought in the day or the night,
waking or sleeping, Your presence my light.
</section>
<section>
2. Lord, be my wisdom and be my true word,
I ever with You and You with me, Lord:
You my great Father and I Your true son,
You in me living and I with You one.
</section>
<section>
3. Lord be my breastplate, my sword for the fight:
be my strong armour, for You are my might;
You are my shelter, You are my high tower,
raise me to heaven, O Pow'r of my power.
</section>
<section>
4. I need no riches, nor man's empty praise:
You my inheritance through all my days;
all of Your treasure to me You impart,
high King of heaven, the first in my heart.
</section>
<section>
5. High King of heaven, after victory won,
grant heaven's joy to me, bright heaven's sun;
Lord of my own heart, whatever befall,
still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
