<h3>Rej 1: Rejoice, the Lord Is King!</h3>

Your Lord and King adore,
mortals, give thanks and sing,
and triumph evermore!

Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>

<h3>PP 4: Come, People of the Risen King</h3>
1. Come, people of the Risen King,
who delight to bring Him praise.
Come all, and tune your hearts to sing
to the Morning Star of grace.

From the shifting shadows of the earth
we will lift our eyes to Him,
where steady arms of mercy reach
to gather children in.

Rejoice, Rejoice!

and those weeping through the night.
Come, those who tell of battles won,
and those struggling in the fight.

and His mercies never cease,
but follow us through all our days
with the certain hope of peace.

<h3>Rej 246: Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side -
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace -
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!
