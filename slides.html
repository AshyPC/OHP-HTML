<h3>Rej 204: The Old Rugged Cross</h3>
1. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suffering and shame;
and I love that old cross where the 
Dearest and Best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.
</section>
<section>
2. For that old rugged cross so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
to bear it to dark Calvary.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.
</section>
<section>
3. In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
a wonderful beauty I see;
for on that rugged cross Jesus suffered and died,
to pardon and sanctify me.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.
</section>
<section>
4. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear;
then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
where His glory for ever I'll share.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

<h3>PP 46: Jerusalem</h3>
1. See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are.
Once these streets had sung to Him;
Now they cry for murder.
</section>
<section>
Such a frail and lonely Man
Holding up the heavy cross -
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us.
</section>
<section>
2. See Him there upon the hill;
Hear the scorn and laughter.
Silent as a lamb He waits,
Praying to the Father.
</section>
<section>
See the King who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down
So that He could save them.
</section>
<section>
3. See Him there upon the cross,
Now no longer breathing.
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section>
Feel the earth is shaking now!
See the veil is split in two!
And He stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with His blood.
</section>
<section>
4. See the empty tomb today -
Death could not contain Him!
Once the Servant of the world
Now in vict'ry reigning!
</section>
<section>
Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne!
See Him in the New Jerusalem -
Praise the One who saved us!

<h3>PP 16: The Power of the Cross</h3>
1. Oh, to see the dawn
Of the darkest day:
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men,
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
This, the pow’r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath -
We stand forgiven at the cross. 
</section>
<section>
2. Oh, to see the pain
Written on Your face,
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Ev’ry bitter thought,
Ev’ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
This, the pow’r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath -
We stand forgiven at the cross. 
</section>
<section>
3. Now the daylight flees;
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Curtain torn in two,
Dead are raised to life;
"Finished!" the vict’ry cry.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
This, the pow’r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath -
We stand forgiven at the cross. 
</section>
<section>
4. Oh, to see my name
Written in the wounds,
For through Your suffering I am free.
Death is crushed to death;
Life is mine to live,
Won through Your selfless love.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
This, the pow’r of the cross:
Son of God—slain for us.
What a love! What a cost! 
We stand forgiven at the cross.

<h3>Rej 218: When I Survey</h3>
1. When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died,
my richest gain I count as loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.
</section>
<section>
2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
save in the cross of Christ my God;
all the vain things that charm me most -
I sacrifice them to His blood.
</section>
<section>
3. See, from His head, His hands, His feet:
sorrow and love flow mingled down.
When did such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?
</section>
<section>
4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an offering far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all!
