<h3>Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side -
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace -
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!

<h3>God Has Spoken - By His Prophets</h3>
1. God has spoken by His prophets,
spoken His unchanging Word;
each from age to age proclaiming
God the One, the righteous Lord;
in the world's despair and turmoil
one firm anchor still holds fast:
God is King, His throne eternal,
God the first and God the last.
</section>
<section>
2. God has spoken by Christ Jesus,
Christ, the everlasting Son;
brightness of the Father's glory,
with the Father ever one:
spoken by the Word incarnate,
God, before all time began,
Light of light, to earth descending,
Man, revealing God to man.
</section>
<section>
3. God is speaking by His Spirit
speaking to the hearts of men;
in the age-long Word expounding
God's own message, now as then.
Through the rise and fall of nations
one sure faith is standing fast:
God abides, His Word unchanging,
God the first and God the last.

<h3>When Upon the Storms of Life</h3>
1. When upon the storms of life 
you're tossed about,
when you are discouraged, 
and begin to doubt,
count your many blessings, 
name them one by one,
and it will surprise you 
what the Lord has done.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Count your blessings, 
name them one by one:
count your blessings, 
see what God has done;
count your blessings, 
name them one by one;
count your many blessings, 
see what God has done.
</section>
<section>
2. Are you ever burdened 
with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy 
you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings, 
ev'ry doubt will fly,
and you will keep singing 
as the days go by.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Count your blessings, 
name them one by one:
count your blessings, 
see what God has done;
count your blessings, 
name them one by one;
count your many blessings, 
see what God has done.
</section>
<section>
3. When you look at others 
with their lands and gold,
think that Christ has promised you 
His wealth untold;
count your many blessings, 
money cannot buy
your reward in heaven, 
nor your home on high.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Count your blessings, 
name them one by one:
count your blessings, 
see what God has done;
count your blessings, 
name them one by one;
count your many blessings, 
see what God has done.
</section>
<section>
4. So, amid the conflict, 
whether great or small,
do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
count your many blessings, 
angels will attend,
help and comfort give you 
to your journey's end.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Count your blessings, 
name them one by one:
count your blessings, 
see what God has done;
count your blessings, 
name them one by one;
count your many blessings, 
see what God has done.
