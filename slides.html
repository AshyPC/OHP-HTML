<h3>Rej 12: Stand Up and Bless The Lord</h3>
1. Stand up and bless the Lord,
you people of His choice;
stand up and praise the Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.
</section>
<section>
2. Though high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His Holy Name,
give thanks and glorify?

3. O for the living flame
from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our minds inspire,
and wing to heaven our thought!
</section>
<section>
4. God is our strength and song,
and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed
with all our ransomed powers.

5. Stand up and bless the Lord,
the Lord your God adore;
stand up and praise His glorious Name
both now and evermore.

<h3>MP 126: Facing a Task Unfinished (Aurelia)</h3>
1. Facing a task unfinished
that drives us to our knees,
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease,
</section>
<section>
We who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before Thy throne
the solemn pledge we owe Thee,
to go and make Thee known.
</section>
<section>
2. Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway,
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today,
</section>
<section>
With none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light,
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.
</section>
<section>
3. We bear the torch that, flaming,
fell from the hands of those
who gave their lives, proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose.
</section>
<section>
Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours
fired by the same ambition
to Thee we yield our powers.
</section>
<section>
4. O Father Who sustained them
O Spirit Who inspired
Saviour, Whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired...
</section>
<section>
from cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us,
to labour for Thy sake.
