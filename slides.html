With Many Crowns</address></section>
<section>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne,
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own!
</section>
<section>
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died for thee
and hail him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
who triumphed o'er the grave,
and rose victorious in the strife
for those He came to save:
</section>
<section>
His glories now we sing
who died and rose on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love;
Behold His hands and side -
Rich wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
</section>
<section>
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends each burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace -
Whose power a sceptre sways
from pole to pole that wars may cease
and all be prayer and praise!
</section>
<section>
His reign shall know no end,
And round his pierced feet,
Fair flowers of paradise extend
their fragrance ever sweet.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
ineffably sublime.
</section>
<section>
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
throughout eternity!

<section><address>Man of Sorrows</address></section>
<section>
1. Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
by His own betrayed;
The sin of man and wrath of God
has been on Jesus laid.
</section>
<section>
2. Silent as He stood accused,
beaten, mocked, and scorned;
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation,
where Your love poured out over me;
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah"!
Praise and honour unto Thee.
</section>
<section>
3. Sent of heaven, God's own Son,
to purchase and redeem
and reconcile the very ones
who nailed Him to that tree!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation,
where Your love poured out over me;
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah"!
Praise and honour unto Thee.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Now my debt is paid -
it is paid in full
by the precious blood
that my Jesus spilled.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Now the curse of sin
has no hold on me;
Whom the Son sets free
oh is free indeed!
</section>

Now my debt is paid -

Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah"!
Praise and honour unto Thee.

4. See, the stone is rolled away;
Behold the empty tomb.
Hallelujah, God be praised -
He's risen from the grave!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation,
where Your love poured out over me;
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah"!
Praise and honour unto Thee.

<section><address>Cornerstone
(My Hope is Built)</address></section>
<section>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

<section><address>In Christ Alone</address></section>
<section>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.

'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
