<h3>PP 4: Come, People of the Risen King</h3>
1. Come, people of the Risen King,
who delight to bring Him praise.
Come all, and tune your hearts to sing
to the Morning Star of grace.

From the shifting shadows of the earth
we will lift our eyes to Him,
where steady arms of mercy reach
to gather children in.

One heart, one voice;

and those weeping through the night.
Come, those who tell of battles won,
and those struggling in the fight.

and His mercies never cease,
but follow us through all our days
with the certain hope of peace.

<h3>PP 12: Jesus Is Lord</h3>
1. "Jesus is Lord" - the cry that echoes through creation;
Resplendent power, eternal Word, our Rock.
The Son of God, the King whose glory fills the heavens,
Yet bids us come to taste this living Bread.
</section>
<section>
2. Jesus is Lord - whose voice sustains the stars and planets,
Yet in His wisdom laid aside His crown.
Jesus the Man, who washed our feet, who bore our suffering,
Became a curse to bring salvation's plan.
</section>
<section>
3. Jesus is Lord - the tomb is gloriously empty!
Not even death could crush this King of love!
The price is paid, the chains are loosed, and we're forgiven,
And we can run into the arms of God.
</section>
<section>
4. "Jesus is Lord" - a shout of joy, a cry of anguish,
As He returns, and every knee bows low.
Then every eye and every heart will see His glory,
The Judge of all will take His children home.

<h4>God's gracious king</h4>

The qualities of God’s King are also the qualities of the Kingdom, and therefore the way of life of all who belong to it.
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<h3><u>1. God’s King does not grasp at power (vv.1-3)</u></h3>

David was content to reign over one tribe in Judah for 7 ½ years.
<aside>
Jesus, “being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped…” (Phil 2:6).  He was willing to walk the way of the cross to the throne.
</aside>
<aside>
What about us? Are we dissatisfied but content in the present because we trust God for a certain future.
</aside>
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<h3><u>2. God’s King extends grace to his enemies (vv.4-7)</u></h3>
<aside>
David was determined to show the people of Jabesh Gilead exceptional loving-kindness, because that is what they showed to Saul as the Lord’s anointed.
</aside>
<aside>
Jesus shows us exceptional loving-kindness.
“…God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)
</aside>
<aside>
Jesus says to us: “I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you…” (Matt 5:44)
</aside>
</section>
<section class=smaller>
<h3><u>3. God’s King will draw opposition from rival kingdoms (vv.8-11)</u></h3>
“Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul … He him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.” (2 Sam 2:8–9)
<aside>
Jesus “came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.” (John 1:11) 
</aside>
<aside>
“In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33)
</aside>

<h3>Rej 246: Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>
1. Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven's eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity.
</section>
<section>
2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those He came to save:
His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
</section>
<section>
3. Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side -
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.
</section>
<section>
4. Crown Him the Lord of peace -
His Kingdom is at hand;
from pole to pole let warfare cease
and Christ rule every land!
A city stands on high,
His glory it displays,
and there the nations 'Holy' cry
in joyful hymns of praise.
</section>
<section>
5. Crown Him the Lord of years,
the Potentate of Time,
Creator of the rolling spheres
in majesty sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail,
for You have died for me;
Your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!
