<h3>Rej 12: Stand Up and Bless The Lord</h3>
1. Stand up and bless the Lord,
you people of His choice;
stand up and praise the Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.
</section>
<section>
2. Though high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His Holy Name,
give thanks and glorify?
</section>
<section>
3. O for the living flame
from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our minds inspire,
and wing to heaven our thought!
</section>
<section>
4. God is our strength and song,
and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed
with all our ransomed powers.
</section>
<section>
5. Stand up and bless the Lord,
the Lord your God adore;
stand up and praise His glorious Name
both now and evermore.

<h3>MP 126: Facing a Task Unfinished (Aurelia)</h3>
1. Facing a task unfinished
that drives us to our knees,
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease,
</section>
<section>
We who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before Thy throne
the solemn pledge we owe Thee,
to go and make Thee known.
</section>
<section>
2. Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway,
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today,
</section>
<section>
With none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light,
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.
</section>
<section>
3. We bear the torch that, flaming,
fell from the hands of those
who gave their lives, proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose.
</section>
<section>
Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours
fired by the same ambition
to Thee we yield our powers.
</section>
<section>
4. O Father Who sustained them
O Spirit Who inspired
Saviour, Whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired...
</section>
<section>
from cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us,
to labour for Thy sake.

<h3>MP 52: Because He lives</h3>
1. God sent His son, they called him Jesus,
He came to love, heal, and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon.
An empty grave is there to prove
my Saviour lives!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow;
Because He lives, all fear is gone!
Because I know He holds the future,
and life is worth the living,
just because He lives.
</section>
<section>
2. How sweet to hold a new-born baby,
And feel the pride and joy he brings,
But greater still, the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days
because <em>He</em> lives.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow;
Because He lives, all fear is gone!
Because I know He holds the future,
and life is worth the living, just because He lives.
</section>
<section>
3. And then, one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain.
And then as death gives way to victory,
I'll see the light of glory and I'll know He lives.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
Because He lives, all fear is gone!
Because I know He holds the future,
and life is worth the living, just because He lives.
