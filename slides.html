<h3>Rej 12: Stand Up and Bless The Lord</h3>
1. Stand up and bless the Lord,
you people of His choice;
stand up and praise the Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.

2. Though high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His Holy Name,
give thanks and glorify?

from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our minds inspire,
and wing to heaven our thought!

and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed

stand up and praise His glorious Name
both now and evermore.

<h3>PP 9: I, the Lord of Sea and Sky</h3>
1. I, the Lord of sea and sky,
I have heard my people cry.
All who dwell in dark or sin
My hand will save.
I, who made the stars of night,
I will make their darkness bright.
Who will bear my light to them?
Whom shall I send?
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Here I am, Lord.
Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you
calling in the night.
I will go, Lord,
If you lead me.
I will hold
your people in my heart.
</section>

2. I, the Lord of snow and rain,
I have borne my people's pain.
I have wept for love of them.
They turn away.
I will break their hearts of stone,
give them hearts for love alone.
I will speak my word to them.
Whom shall I send?
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Here I am, Lord.
Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you
calling in the night.
I will go, Lord,
If you lead me.
I will hold
your people in my heart.

3. I, the Lord of wind and flame,
I will tend the poor and lame.
I will set a feast for them.
My hand will save.
Finest bread I will provide
till their hearts are satisfied.
I will give my life to them.
Whom shall I send?
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Here I am, Lord.
Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you
calling in the night.
I will go, Lord,
If you lead me.

<h3>Rej 464: A Charge to Keep I Have</h3>
1. A charge to keep I have,
a God to glorify,
a never-dying soul to save
to live eternally.

2. To serve the present age,
my calling to fulfil:
O may it all my powers employ
to do my Master's will!

as in Your sight to live,
and, O, Your servant Lord prepare
a strict account to give.

4. Help me to watch and pray,
and on You, Lord, rely,
and let me ne'er my trust betray,
but press to realms on high.
