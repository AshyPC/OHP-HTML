<h3>Rej 176: It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</h3>
1. It came upon the midnight clear,
that glorious song of old,
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold:
</section>
<section>
'Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
from heaven's all-gracious King!'
The world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing.
</section>
<section>
2. With sorrow brought by sin and strife
the world has suffered long
and, since the angels sang, have passed
two thousand years of wrong:
</section>
<section>
for man at war with man hears not
the love-song which they bring:
O hush the noise, you men of strife,
and hear the angels sing!
</section>
<section>
3. And those whose journey now is hard,
whose hope is burning low,
who tread the rocky path of life
with painful steps and slow:
</section>
<section>
O listen to the news of love
which makes the heavens ring!
O rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing!
</section>
<section>
4. And still the days are hastening on --
by prophets seen of old --
towards the fullness of the time
when comes the age foretold:
</section>
<section>
when earth and heaven renewed shall see
the Prince of Peace, their King;
and all the world repeat the song
which now the angels sing.

<h3>Rej 587: What a Wonderful Change</h3>

1. What a wonderful change
in my life has been wrought
since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul
which for long I had sought
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul
like the sea billows roll,
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section>
2. I have ceased from my wand'ring
and going astray,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And my sins, which were many,
are all washed away,
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul
like the sea billows roll,
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section>
3. I shall go there to dwell
in that City, I know,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And I'm happy, so happy,
as onward I go
since Jesus came into my heart.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul
like the sea billows roll,
since Jesus came into my heart.

<h3>Rej 168: Tell Out, My Soul</h3>
1. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!
Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
tender to me the promise of His Word;
in God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.
</section>
<section>
2. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His Name!
Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done
His mercy sure, from age to age the same,
His holy Name, the Lord, the Mighty One!
</section>
<section>
3. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might!
Powers and dominions lay their glory by.
Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.
</section>
<section>
4. Tell out, my soul, the glories of His Word!
Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord,
to children's children, and forevermore!
