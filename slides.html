<h3>Rej 51: Holy Holy Holy</h3>
1. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!
Early in the morning 
our song of praise shall be:
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, glorious Trinity.
</section>
<section>
2. Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore You,
casting down their golden crowns 
around the glassy sea.
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before You:
You were and are, and evermore shall be!
</section>
<section>
3. Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide You,
though the eye of sinful man 
Your glory may not see, 
You alone are holy, there is none beside You, 
perfect in pow'r, in love and purity.
</section>

4. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!
All Your works shall praise Your Name,
in earth and sky and sea:
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, glorious Trinity.

<h3>Rej 515: Search Me, O God</h3>
Search me, O God, and know my heart today;
try me, O Saviour, know my thoughts, I pray.
See if there be some wicked way in me.
Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.
</section>
<section>
I praise You, Lord, for cleansing me from sin.
Fulfil Your Word and make me pure within.
Fill me with fire where once I burned with shame;
grant my desire to magnify Your Name.
</section>
<section>
Lord, take my life, my sinful soul refine;
fill my poor heart with Your great love divine.
Take all my will, my passion, self, and pride;
I now surrender, Lord, in my abide.
</section>
<section>
Spirit of God, I would Your temple be.
Send a revival - start the work in me.
Your Word declares You will supply our need;
for blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
