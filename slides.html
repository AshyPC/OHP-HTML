<h3>PP 37: 10,000 Reasons</h3>
<i>Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.</i>
</section>
<section>
1. The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
It's time to sing your song again.
Whatever may pass,
And whatever lies before me,
Let me be singing when the evening comes.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
</section>
<section>
2. You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
Your name is great and your heart is kind.
For all your goodness, I will keep on singing;
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.
</section>
<section>
3. And on that day, when my strength is failing,
The end draws near, and my time has come;
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore!
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul,
Oh my soul; worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, Oh my soul;
I'll worship your holy name.

<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

<h3>Rej 32: God Is Our Strength and Refuge</h3>
1. God is our strength and refuge,
our present help in trouble;
and we therefore will not fear,
though the earth should change!
Though mountains shake and tremble,
though swirling floods are raging,
God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
</section>
<section>
2. There is a flowing river,
within God's holy city;
God is in the midst of her:
she shall not be moved!
God's help is swiftly given,
thrones vanish at His presence:
God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
</section>
<section>
3. Come, see the works of our Maker,
learn of His deeds all-powerful;
wars will cease across the world
when He shatters the spear!
Be still and know your Creator,
uplift Him in the nations:
God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!

<h3>Rej 474: Rise Up, You Saints of God</h3>
1. Rise up, you saints of God,
from vain ambitions turn;
Christ rose triumphant that your hearts
with nobler zeal might burn.
</section>
<section>
2. Speak out, you saints of God,
despair engulfs earth's frame!
As heirs of God's all-saving grace,
His Word of hope proclaim.
</section>
<section>
3. Rise up, you saints of God,
His Kingdom's task embrace!
Redress sin's cruel consequence;
give justice greater place.
</section>
<section>
4. Give heed, you saints of God,
creation cries in pain!
Stretch forth your hand of healing now,
with love the weak sustain.
</section>
<section>
5. Commit your hearts to seek
the paths which Christ has trod,
and strengthened by the Spirit's power,
rise up, you saints of God.
