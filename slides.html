<h3>Rej 455: Onward, Christian Soldiers</h3>
1. Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus
going on before.
</section>
<section>
Christ, the Royal Master,
leads His armies on:
forward into battle
till the fight is won!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus
going on before.
</section>
<section>
2. Like a mighty army,
moves the church of God.
Brothers, we are treading
where the saints have trod.
</section>
<section>
We are not divided
All one body, we
One in hope, in doctrine,
one in charity
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus
going on before.
</section>
<section>
3. At the Name of Jesus,
Satan's armies flee;
on then, Christian soldiers,
on to victory!
</section>
<section>
Hell's foundations tremble
at the shout of praise.
Sing the song of triumph!
Loud your voices raise!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus
going on before.
</section>
<section>
4. Crowns and thrones may perish,
kingdoms rise and wane,
but the church of Jesus
ever shall remain.
</section>
<section>
Death and hell and Satan
never shall prevail;
we have Christ's own promise,
and that cannot fail.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus
going on before.
</section>
<section>
5. Onward then, you people!
March in faith, be strong!
Blend with ours your voices
in the triumph song
</section>
<section>
Glory, praise, and honour
give to Christ the King!
This through countless ages
men and angels sing:
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Onward, Christian soldiers,
marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus
going on before.
