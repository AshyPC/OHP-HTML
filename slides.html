<h3>MP 51: Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might,
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward,
    O Power of my power.
</section>
<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only be first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, when victory is won,
May I reach heaven's joys,
    O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.

<h3>PP 43: My Heart Is Filled</h3>
1. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who bore my pain;
Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace
and gave me life again;
</section>
<section>
Who crushed my curse of sinfulness,
and clothed me in His light,
and wrote His law of righteousness
with power upon my heart.
</section>
<section>
2. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who walks beside;
Who floods my weaknesses with strength
and causes fear to fly;
</section>
<section>
Whose every promise is enough
for every step I take;
sustaining me with arms of love
and crowning me with grace.
</section>
<section>
3. My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who reigns above;
Whose wisdom is my perfect peace,
Whose every thought is love.
</section>
<section>
For every day I have on earth
is given by the King.
So I will give my life, my all,
to love and follow Him.

<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
</section>
<section>
2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section>
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

Hope in Christ means grieving well

Loss is part of life in a broken world.
<aside>
Grief is normal…

A lament gives words to what is in the heart. 
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3><u>1. Grief increases our longing &amp; motivates us to action (vv.17-21).</u></h3>
We are not to be shoddy in our grieving.
<aside>
As believers, we need learn to grieve well, so grief does not turn inward in a destructive way, but is turned outward in dependence on Lord &amp; action.

Let our grief increase our longing for the glory God has promised, &amp; motivate us to work for it.
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3><u>2. Grief is gracious – it thinks the best (vv.22-23)</u></h3>
Grief is gracious because it is the flip side of love – i.e. it arises from the loss of what is loved. 
<aside>Failure to be gracious (delighting in the misfortune of others) arises from pride – we think we are more deserving.
Such thinking shows we have not understood the gospel. The gospel leaves no room to delight in the misfortune of others.</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3 style="font-size:95%;"><u>3. Grief reveals what is in our hearts, because we grieve most over what we love most (vv.24-27)</u></h3>
David grieved the defeat and the death of Saul, but his greatest grief was for the loss of Jonathan.
<aside>
Their relationship was about covenant devotion that had its source in the Lord and rested in Him.
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
Matthew Henry: “The more we love, the more we grieve.”
<aside>
What grieves you?  Our grief reveals what we love most.
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3><u>Faith under our grieving.</u></h3>
1 Thessalonians 4:13: Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
<aside>
Paul Tripp warns : “…suffering has a way of entering our door, and when it does, we’d better have handholds to reach for that keep us from being swept away by the power, discouragement, and helplessness of it all.” 
</aside>
</section>
<section class=black>
We cope because we hold on to Jesus and His promises and the hope that comes from an horizon that stretches into eternity.

<blockquote>Isaiah 53:4: Jesus <i>“…has borne our griefs &amp; carried our sorrows…”</i></blockquote>
He redeems our sorrow and suffering and builds glory from it! 
</section>
<section class="black" style="color:#E6D4C5;">
Jesus <i>“bore our griefs and carried our sorrows”</i> on the cross, and so, like David,
<ul><li>our grieving can increase our longing and move us to action;</li>
<li>in our grieving we can be gracious; and</li>
<li>in our grieving, may we testify to the love of that which is most lovely.</li></ul>

<h3>PP 2: Behold The Lamb</h3>
1. Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
slain for us
and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of peace
around the table of the King.
</section>
<section>
2. The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
torn for you
eat and remember:
The wounds that heal,
the death that brings us life
paid the price to make us one.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of love
around the table of the King.

3. The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
shed for you
drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
to receive the life of God.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of grace
around the table of the King.
</section>
<section>
4. And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
to respond
and to remember
our call to follow in the steps of Christ
as His body here on earth.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
As we share
in His suffering,
we proclaim
Christ will come again!
And we'll join
in the feast of heaven
around the table of the King.
