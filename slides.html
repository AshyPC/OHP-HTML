<h3>PP 3: By Faith</h3>
1. By faith we see the hand of God
in the light of creation's grand design,
in the lives of those who prove His faithfulness,
who walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
2. By faith our fathers roamed the earth
with the power of His promise in their hearts,
of a holy city built by God's own hand,
a place where peace and justice reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
3. By faith the prophets saw a day
when the longed-for Messiah would appear
with the power to break
the chains of sin and death
and rise triumphant from the grave.
</section>
<section>
4. By faith the church was called to go
in the power of the Spirit to the lost
to deliver captives and to preach good news
in every corner of the earth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
5. By faith this mountain shall be moved
and the power of the gospel shall prevail,
for we know in Christ all things are possible
for all who call upon His Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.

<h3>PP 38: Across the Lands</h3>
1. You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand
</section>
<section>
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice
Let the skies declare Your glory
Let the land and seas rejoice
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
2. Yet You left the gaze of angels
Came to seek and save the lost
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross
</section>
<section>
With a prayer You fed the hungry
With a word You stilled the sea
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands
</section>
<section>
3. With a shout You rose victorious
Wresting victory from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your wake
</section>
<section>
Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home
</section>
<section class=refrain>
You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

<h3>PP 48: Facing a Task Unfinished</h3>
1. Facing a task unfinished
that drives us to our knees,
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease,
</section>
<section>
We who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before Thy throne
the solemn pledge we owe Thee,
to go and make Thee known.
</section>
<section>
2. Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway,
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today,
</section>
<section>
With none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light,
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled.
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord.
</section>
<section>
3. We bear the torch that, flaming,
fell from the hands of those
who gave their lives, proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose.
</section>
<section>
Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours
fired by the same ambition
to Thee we yield our powers.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled.
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord.
</section>
<section>
4. O Father Who sustained them
O Spirit Who inspired
Saviour, Whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired...
</section>
<section>
from cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us,
to labour for Thy sake.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled.
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord.

<h3>1. Hesitation</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. (28:16-17)
</section>
<section class=black>
Resurrection was not anticipated
</section>
<section class=black>
People were still in mourning of Jesus’ death on the cross
</section>
<section class=black>
Even when Jesus was walking on earth with these people and Jesus appeared before their very eyes after resurrecting from the grave, there were negative reactions.
</section>
<section class=black>
Just as there was initial hesitation... there will be people who will be unable to recognise Jesus when we share the gospel with others
</section>
<section class=black>
Sharing the message of Jesus, and making disciples is uncomfortable
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>2. Confidence</h3>


“Then Jesus came to them and said, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.’” (28:18)
</section>
<section class=black>
We do not make Jesus Lord, but He is the Lord of the universe no matter what we confess.
</section>
<section class=black>
We know that it only makes sense to make Jesus’ name be known.
</section>
<section class=black>
“He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.” (Daniel 7:14)
</section>
<section class=black>
He replied, “You of little faith, why are you so afraid?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. 

(Matthew 8:26)
</section>
<section class=black>
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them.
(Matthew 4:23-24)
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>3. Obedience</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>
“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.” (28:19-20a)
</section>
<section class=black>
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <u>“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”</u> At once they left their nets and followed him.

Matthew 4:18-20
</section>
<section class=black>
He orders us to go, baptise, and teach
</section>
<section class=black>
To be disciples is to make disciples
</section>
<section class=black>
Obedience to a command like this takes discipline
</section>
<section class=black>
Jesus calls us to continue his ministry of leading lives back to the Father.
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>4. Dependence</h3>

“And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (28:20b)
</section>
<section class=black>
Once we depend on what our talents are and what we can do, we become disappointed and frustrated when things don’t go the way we want.
</section>
<section class=black>
We are not to take pride in our work thinking it is enough; that I am enough
</section>
<section class=black>
We radiate the love of Jesus, by loving Jesus and loving others.
</section>
<section class=black>
“In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself <u>nothing</u> by taking the very nature of <u>a servant</u>, being made in <u>human likeness</u>. And being found in appearance as a man, he <u>humbled</u> himself by becoming <u>obedient</u> to death— even death on a cross!” (Phil. 2:5-8)
</section>
<section class=black>
“The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.” (Rom. 1:18-19)

<h3>PP 39: This Life I Live</h3>
1. This life I live is not my own,
For my Redeemer paid the price.
He took it to be his alone,
To be his treasure and his prize.
</section>
<section>
The things of earth I leave behind
To live in worship of my King.
His is the right to rule my life,
Mine is the joy to live for him.
</section>
<section>
2. I died to sin upon the cross.
I'm bound to Jesus in his death.
The old is gone, and now I must
Rely on him for every breath.
</section>
<section>
With every footstep that I tread,
What mysteries he has in store.
I cannot know what lies ahead,
But know that he has gone before.
</section>
<section>
3. There is a voice that pierced the grave,
A power that rolled the stone away.
A sound of life, I know I'm saved,
The voice of God has called my name.
</section>
<section>
So I will rise, and in the air
Behold the glory of the King.
I will not fear to meet him there.
I know my life is hid with him.
(Repeat)
