<h3>MP 975: Before The Throne of God Above</h3>
1. Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
a great High Priest, whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
</section>
<section>
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
</section>
<section>
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
who made an end of all my sin.
</section>
<section>
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.
</section>
<section>
3. Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
</section>
<section>
One with Himself, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.
