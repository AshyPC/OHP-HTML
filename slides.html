<h3>PP 3: By Faith</h3>
1. By faith we see the hand of God
in the light of creation's grand design,
in the lives of those who prove His faithfulness,
who walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
2. By faith our fathers roamed the earth
with the power of His promise in their hearts,
of a holy city built by God's own hand,
a place where peace and justice reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
3. By faith the prophets saw a day
when the longed-for Messiah would appear
with the power to break
the chains of sin and death
and rise triumphant from the grave.
</section>
<section>
4. By faith the church was called to go
in the power of the Spirit to the lost
to deliver captives and to preach good news
in every corner of the earth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.
</section>
<section>
5. By faith this mountain shall be moved
and the power of the gospel shall prevail,
for we know in Christ all things are possible
for all who call upon His Name.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
We will stand as children of the promise;
We will fix our eyes on Him, our soul's reward.
Till the race is finished and the work is done,
we'll walk by faith and not by sight.

<h3>MP 506: How Great Thou Art</h3>
1. O Lord my God,
when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works Thy hand has made;
I see the stars,
I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
</section>
<section>
2. And when I think
that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die - I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin:
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
</section>
<section>
3. When Christ shall come
with shout of acclamation,
And take me home - what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And then proclaim,
"My God, how great Thou art!"
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

<h3>Rej 586: When Peace Like a River</h3>
1. When peace, like a river, 
flows all through my life,
when sorrows like sea billows roll;
whatever my lot, You have taught me to say:
It is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
2. Though Satan should buffet, 
though trials should come,
let this blest assurance control:
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate
and has shed His own blood for my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
3. My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought,
my sin, not in part, but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more:
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section>
4. And, Lord, haste the day when 
my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll:
the trumpet shall sound and the Lord shall descend,
'Even so' - it is well with my soul.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
It is well, it is well 
with my soul, with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.

<h3><u>While We Wait</u></h3>



The concept of waiting is almost extinct.

<h3>1. The Delay of His Return</h3>



It is a long delay as it is still ongoing.
</section>
<section class=black>


We feel frustrated because it seems like God is not answering our prayers.
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>How long will the return of Jesus</h3>
<h3>be delayed?</h3>

We cannot be sure because Jesus is also not sure.
Jesus says, "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." (24:36)
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>Before Jesus comes, everything will</h3>
<h3>be normal.</h3>

We will be just living our everyday lives: going to school, university, and work.
We will be having our routines.
People will going to the gym.
People will be getting married.

<h3>Judgement.</h3>


"Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and other left."
(24:40-41)
</section>
<section class=black>
We are not to assume that baptism, leadership status, title, and the quantity of service to the church automatically means being adopted into God’s family.
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>2. Keep Watch</h3>



"Keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come." (24:42)
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>a. Anticipate Jesus’ Return</h3>



The day of the Lord’s return is an exciting time!
</section>
<section class=black>
"So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him." (24:44)
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>b. Being Prepared</h3>



To be prepared means trusting Jesus.
</section>
<section class=black>
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away." (24:35)

8 The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'

9 "'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, <u>go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'</u>

10 "But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.

11 "Later the others also came. 'Lord, Lord,' they said, 'open the door for us!'

12 "But he replied, <u>'Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.'</u>

Jesus is warning against, lukewarm and mediocre faith.
</section>
<section class=black>


Jesus never does promise a good life. 

Rather, he says, "You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved." (10:22)
</section>
<section class=black>
Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. 
2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
<p style="font-size:20px">Romans 12:1-2</p>

<h3>3. Faithfully Follow</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>a. Obedience</h3>


It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. (24:36)
</section>
<section class=black>


Our faith and Jesus calling is not about being legalistic. 
Rather he is asking for a response, a transformation of the heart.
</section>
<section class=black>


The argument now would not just be "My master is staying away a long time," anymore, but rather people are now saying, "My Master does not exist."
</section>
<section class=black>


"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money." (6:24)
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>b. Good Stewards</h3>
</section>
<section class=black>


"The man’s eyes are sparkling. He is bubbling over with enthusiasm, is thoroughly thrilled, and as it were, invites his master to start counting."
-William Hendriksen-
</section>
<section class=black>


"Master, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you." (25:24-25)
</section>
<section class=black>


The way the last servant viewed his master is the way the world views Jesus.
</section>
<section class=black>


Do you acknowledge that everything that we have is owned by God? 
Do you acknowledge everything is graciously given our Father?
