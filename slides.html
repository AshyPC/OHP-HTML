<h3>Rej 370: We Have Heard The Joyful Sound</h3>
1. We have heard the joyful sound:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to ev'ry land,
climb the steeps and cross the waves;
onward -- 'tis our Lord's command:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

2. Waft it on the rolling tide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing, O islands of the sea!
Echo back, you ocean caves!
Earth shall keep her jubilee:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

3. Sing above the battle strife:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
By His death and endless life:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing it softly through the gloom,
when the heart for mercy craves;
sing in triumph o'er the tomb:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>

4. Give the winds a mighty voice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free,
highest hills and deepest caves;
this our song of victory:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
