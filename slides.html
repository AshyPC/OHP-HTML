<h3>Rej 576: Loved with Everlasting Love</h3>
1. Loved with everlasting love,
led by grace that love to know;
Spirit breathing from above,
You have taught me it is so:
</section>
<section>
O what full and perfect peace,
joy and wonder all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His and He is mine;
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His and He is mine.
</section>
<section>
2. Heaven above is softer blue,
earth around is richer green;
something lives in every hue,
Christless eyes have never seen:
</section>
<section>
Songs of birds in sweetness grow,
flowers with deeper beauties shine,
since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine;
since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine.
</section>
<section>
3. His forever, His alone!
Who the Lord from me shall part?
With what joy and peace unknown
Christ can fill the loving heart!
</section>
<section>
Heaven and earth may pass away,
sun and stars in gloom decline,
but of Christ I still shall say:
I am His and He is mine.
But of Christ I still shall say:
I am His and He is mine.
