<h3>Rej 123: At the Name of Jesus</h3>
1. At the name of Jesus,
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess him
King of Glory, now!
</section>
<section>
This the Father's pleasure
That we call Him Lord
Who from the beginning
was the mighty Word.
</section>
<section>
2. At His voice creation
sprang at once to sight,
all the angel faces,
all the hosts of light.
</section>
<section>
Thrones and all dominions,
stars upon their way,
all the heavenly orders
in their grand array.
</section>
<section>
3. Humbled for a season
to receive a name
from the lips of sinners
unto whom He came.
</section>
<section>
Faithfully He bore it,
spotless to the last.
Brought it back victorious
when from death He passed.
</section>
<section>
4. Name Him, brothers, name Him,
with love strong as death,
but with awe and wonder,
and with bated breath.
</section>
<section>
He is God the Saviour,
He is Christ the Lord,
ever to be worshipped,
trusted and adored.
</section>
<section>
5. In your hearts enthrone him,
there let Him subdue
all that is not holy,
all that is not true.
</section>
<section>
Crown Him as your captain
in temptation's hour.
Let His will enfold you
in its light and power.
</section>
<section>
6. Brothers, this Lord Jesus
shall return again
With His Father's glory,
with His angel train.
</section>
<section>
For all wreaths of empire
meet upon His brow,
and our hearts confess Him
King of Glory now!

<h3>Rej 1: Rejoice, the Lord Is King!</h3>

Your Lord and King adore,
mortals, give thanks and sing,
and triumph evermore!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>

2. Jesus the Saviour reigns,
the God of truth and love
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above!

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>

He rules both earth and heaven
The keys of death and hell
To Jesus now are given.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
4. He sits at God's right hand,
till all His foes submit
and bow to His command
and fall beneath His feet.

<i>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
Rejoice! Again I say: Rejoice!</i>
</section>
<section>
5. Rejoice in glorious hope,
Jesus the Judge shall come
and take His servants up
to their eternal home!

<i>We soon shall hear the archangel's voice,
the trumpet's sound: Rejoice! Rejoice!</i>

<h3>Rej 168: Tell Out, My Soul</h3>
1. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!
Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
tender to me the promise of His Word;
in God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.
</section>
<section>
2. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His Name!
Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done
His mercy sure, from age to age the same,
His holy Name, the Lord, the Mighty One!
</section>
<section>
3. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might!
Powers and dominions lay their glory by.
Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.
</section>
<section>
4. Tell out, my soul, the glories of His Word!
Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord,
to children's children, and forevermore!
