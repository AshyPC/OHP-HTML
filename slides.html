<h1>The God of Abraham Praise</h1>
1. The God of Abraham praise
who reigns enthroned above;
the ancient of eternal days
and God of love!
</section>
<section>
The Lord, the great I AM,
by earth and heaven confessed;
we bow before His Holy Name
forever blessed.
</section>
<section>
2. He by His Name has sworn:
on this we shall depend,
and as on eagles' wings upborne
to heaven ascend;
</section>
<section>
there we shall see His face,
His pow'r we shall adore,
and sing the wonders of His grace
forevermore.
</section>
<section>
3. There rules the Lord our King,
the Lord our righteousness,
victorious over death and sin,
the Prince of Peace.
</section>
<section>
On Zion's sacred height	
His Kingdom He maintains,
and glorious with His saints in light
forever reigns.
</section>
<section>
4. Triumphant hosts on high
give thanks eternally
and 'Holy, holy, holy' cry,
'Great Trinity!'
</section>
<section>
Hail Abraham's God and ours!
One mighty hymn we raise,
all power and majesty be Yours
and endless praise!

<h1>Come, People of the Risen King</h1>
1. Come, people of the Risen King,
who delight to bring Him praise.
Come all, and tune your hearts to sing
to the Morning Star of grace.
</section>
<section>
From the shifting shadows of the earth
we will lift our eyes to Him,
where steady arms of mercy reach
to gather children in.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Rejoice, Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice;
O Church of Christ, rejoice!
</section>
<section>
2. Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
and those weeping through the night.
Come, those who tell of battles won,
and those struggling in the fight.
</section>
<section>
For His perfect love will never change,
and His mercies never cease,
but follow us through all our days
with the certain hope of peace.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Rejoice, Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice;
O Church of Christ, rejoice!
</section>
<section>
3. Come, young and old from every land,
men and women of the faith.
Come, those with full or empty hands,
find the riches of His grace.
</section>
<section>
Over all the world, His people sing;
shore to shore we hear them call
the Truth that cries through every age:
"Our God is all in all"!
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Rejoice, Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice;
O Church of Christ, rejoice!

<h1>God Moves in a Mysterious Way</h1>
1. God moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps on the sea,
and rides upon the storm.
</section>
<section>
2. Deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill
He treasures up His bright designs,
and works His sovereign will.
</section>
<section>
3. You fearful saints, fresh courage take;
the clouds you so much dread
are filled with mercy, and shall break
in blessings on your head.
</section>
<section>
4. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
but trust Him for His grace;
behind a frowning providence
faith sees a smiling face.
</section>
<section>
5. His purposes will ripen fast,
unfolding every hour;
the bud may have a bitter taste,
but sweet will be the flower.
</section>
<section>
6. Blind unbelief is sure to err,
and scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
and He will make it plain.
<cite>William Cowper 1731-1800</cite>

<h1>On God Alone My Soul Relies</h1>
1. On God alone my soul relies,
and He will help me soon;
the Lord will hear my heartfelt cries
at morning, night and noon.
</section>
<section>
2. My soul He has redeemed in peace,
from conflict set me free;
my many foes are made to cease,
and strive no more with me.
</section>
<section>
3. The living God in righteousness
will justly pay with shame
all those who, hardened by success,
forget to fear His Name.
</section>
<section>
4. All treach'rous friends who me attack
and break their promised word,
who hide their hate with cunning speech,
will know the wrath of God.
</section>
<section>
5. Upon the Lord your burden cast,
to Him bring all your care;
He will sustain and hold you fast,
and give you strength to bear.
</section>
<section>
6. God will not let His saints be moved;
protected they shall be,
foes all cut off and sin reproved;
and God's salvation see.
