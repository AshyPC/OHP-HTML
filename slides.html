<h3>PP 52: For the Cause</h3>
1. For the cause of Christ the King
We give our lives, an offering
’Til all the earth
Resounds with ceaseless praise
To the Son.
</section>
<section>
2. For the cause of Christ we go
With joy to reap, with faith to sow
As many see
And many put their trust
in the Son.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ we proclaim,
The Name above every name:
For all creation,
Ev’ry nation,
God’s salvation
Through the Son!
</section>
<section>
3. For the King once lifted high
To cries of rage, of ‘crucify!’
Endured the cross
As every sin was laid
On the Son.
</section>
<section>
4. To the King who conquered death
To free the poor and the oppressed
For lasting peace
For life and liberty
In the Son.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ we proclaim,
The Name above every name:
For all creation,
Ev’ry nation,
God’s salvation
Through the Son!
</section>
<section>
5. Let it be my life’s refrain:
To live is Christ, to die is gain;
Deny myself,
Take up my cross
And follow the Son.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ we proclaim,
The Name above every name:
For all creation,
Ev’ry nation,
God’s salvation
Through the Son!

<h3>Rej 382: Come Thou Fount</h3>
1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
mount of Thy redeeming love.
</section>
<section>
2. Here I raise my Ebenezer,
hither by thy help I've come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
interposed His precious blood.
</section>
<section>
3. Oh, to grace how great a debtor
daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wandering heart to Thee:
prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here's my heart, O take and seal it;
seal it for thy courts above.

<h3>PP 36: Jesus, Thank You</h3>
1. The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
The agonies of Calvary
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You
</section>
<section>
2. By Your perfect sacrifice I’ve been brought near
Your enemy You’ve made Your friend
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.

'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
