<h3>Rej 370: Jesus Saves</h3>
1. We have heard the joyful sound:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
Bear the news to ev'ry land,
climb the steeps and cross the waves;
onward -- 'tis our Lord's command:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
2. Waft it on the rolling tide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
Sing, O islands of the sea!
Echo back, you ocean caves!
Earth shall keep her jubilee:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
3. Sing above the battle strife:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
By His death and endless life:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
Sing it softly through the gloom,
when the heart for mercy craves;
sing in triumph o'er the tomb:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
4. Give the winds a mighty voice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
</section>
<section>
Shout salvation full and free,
highest hills and deepest caves;
this our song of victory:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

<h3>MP 544: Open My Eyes That I May See</h3>
1. Open my eyes that I may see
glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
place in my hands the wonderful key
that shall unclasp and set me free.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Silently now I wait for Thee
ready, my God, Thy will to see;
open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!
</section>
<section>
2. Open my ears that I may hear
voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
and while the wave-notes fall on my ear
everything false will disappear.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Silently now I wait for Thee
ready, my God, Thy will to see;
open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!
</section>
<section>
3. Open my mouth and let me bear
tidings of mercy everywhere;
open my heart and let me prepare
love with thy children thus to share.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Silently now I wait for Thee
ready, my God, Thy will to see;
open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!
</section>

4. Open my mind, that I may read
more of Thy love in word and deed.
What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead.
</section>
<section class="refrain">
Silently now I wait for Thee
ready, my God, Thy will to see;
open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!
