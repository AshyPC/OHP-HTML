<h3>Rej 316: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</h3>
1. A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing.
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing:

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.
</section>
<section>
2. Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing.

You ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He.
The Lord of Hosts, His Name -
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.
</section>
<section>
3. And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us.

The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
we know his doom is sure,
the Word of God shall fell him.
</section>
<section>
4. That Word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, is standing;
the Spirit and His gifts are ours -
we answer His commanding.

Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill,
God's truth is ruling still -
His kingdom is forever!

<h3>PP 11: In Christ Alone</h3>
1. In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my light, my strength, my song.
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all:
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
</section>
<section>
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh -
Fullness of God in helpless Babe.
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save.

'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.
</section>
<section>
3. There in the ground His body lay:
Light of the world by darkness slain.
Then, bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</section>
<section>
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death -
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home -
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

<h3>Rej 148: You Servants of God</h3>
1. You servants of God, your master proclaim,
and publish abroad His wonderful Name;
the Name all-victorious of Jesus extol,
His Kingdom is glorious and rules over all.
</section>
<section>
2. God rules in the height, almighty to save;
though hid from our sight
His presence we have.
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.
</section>
<section>
3. 'Salvation to God who sits on the throne!'
Let all cry aloud, and honour the Son;
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.
</section>
<section>
4. Then let us adore and give Him His right:
all glory and power, all wisdom and might,
all honour and blessing with angels above
and thanks never ceasing, and infinite love.

<h1>God’s kingdom,

God’s way</h1>

Our sense that we are in control is an illusion…
<blockquote>Daniel 2:21a
He changes times and seasons;
he deposes kings and raises up others.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Psalm 75:6–7
No one from the east or the west
or from the desert can exalt themselves.
It is God who judges:
He brings one down, he exalts another.</blockquote>
</section>
<section class=black>
Behind our self-deception that we are in control is an attitude of pride that thinks we are able.

<h3>1. Two men seeking the Kingdom
their way.</h3>
<aside>
2 Samuel 4:8
They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day the Lord has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.”
</aside>

<h3>2. A Kingdom not established by
human hands.</h3>
<img class=imgright src="GodsKingdomGodsWay3.png"></img>
Daniel 2:44–45 
“In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.
</section>
<section class=black>

This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.  “The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
</section>
<section class=black>
Psalm 127:1
Unless the LORD builds the house,
the builders labour in vain.

If we need the Lord to build into our families so our work is not fruitless, how much more do depend on Him to build His Kingdom.
</section>
<section class=black>
<h3>3. A Kingdom not thwarted by
human hands.</h3>
Daniel 2:21
…He deposes kings and raises up others.

Proverbs 19:21
Many are the plans in a person’s heart,  but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails.

Matthew 16:18
Jesus answered him, “…I will build my church”
</section>
<section class=smaller>
Isaiah 55:11
…so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.

We acknowledge that we are not strong, wise or powerful enough to bring about the Kingdom, but He is, and so we live, work, pray and act in dependence on the Lord, not being impatient, but knowing that future belongs to Him, and His promises are certain.

<h3>MP 51: Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
</section>
<section>
Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might,
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward,
    O Power of my power.
</section>
<section>
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and Thou only be first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
</section>
<section>
High King of heaven, when victory is won,
May I reach heaven's joys,
    O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
