<h3>Rej 254: Jesus Comes With Clouds Descending</h3>
1. Jesus comes with clouds descending,
see the Lamb for sinners slain!
Thousand thousand saints attending
join to sing the glad refrain:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
God appears on earth to reign.
</section>
<section>
2. Every eye shall then behold Him
robed in awesome majesty;
those who jeered at Him and sold Him,
pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
shamed and grieving, shamed and grieving,
shamed and grieving,
shall their true Messiah see.
</section>
<section>
3. Now redemption, long expected,
see in majesty appear;
all His saints by man rejected
now shall meet Him in the air.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
See the day of God appear.
</section>
<section>
4. Lord, amen! Let all adore You
high on Your eternal throne;
crowns and empires fall before You:
claim the Kingdom for Your own.
Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!
Everlasting God, come down.

<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.

2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.

3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne.

slain for us_
and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.

So we share
in this bread of life,
and we drink
of His sacrifice
as a sign
of our bonds of peace
around the table of the King.

torn for you_
eat and remember:
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life
paid the price to make us one.

to respond_
and to remember
our call to follow in the steps of Christ
as His body here on earth.

As we share
in His suffering,
we proclaim
Christ will come again!
And we'll join
in the feast of heaven
around the table of the King.
