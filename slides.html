<h3>Rej 576: Loved with Everlasting Love</h3>
1. Loved with everlasting love,
led by grace that love to know;
Spirit breathing from above,
You have taught me it is so:
</section>
<section>
O what full and perfect peace,
joy and wonder all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His and He is mine;
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His and He is mine.
</section>
<section>
2. Heaven above is softer blue,
earth around is richer green;
something lives in every hue,
Christless eyes have never seen:
</section>
<section>
Songs of birds in sweetness grow,
flowers with deeper beauties shine,
since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine;
since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine.
</section>
<section>
3. His forever, His alone!
Who the Lord from me shall part?
With what joy and peace unknown
Christ can fill the loving heart!
</section>
<section>
Heaven and earth may pass away,
sun and stars in gloom decline,
but of Christ I still shall say:
I am His and He is mine.
But of Christ I still shall say:
I am His and He is mine.

<h3>Rej 368: God is working His purpose out</h3>
1. God is working His purpose out,
as year succeeds to year:
God is working His purpose out,
and the time is drawing near:
</section>
<section>
nearer and nearer draws the time,
the time that shall surely be,
when the earth shall be filled
with the glory of God,
as the waters cover the sea.
</section>
<section>
2. From utmost east to utmost west,
wherever man has trod,
by the mouth of many messengers
rings out the voice of God:
</section>
<section>
"Listen to Me you continents,
you islands look to Me,
that the earth may be filled
with the glory of God,
as the waters cover the sea."
</section>
<section>
3. We shall march in the strength of God,
with the banner of Christ unfurled,
that the light of the glorious Gospel of truth
may shine throughout the world;
</section>
<section>
we shall fight with sorrow and sin
to set their captives free,
that the earth may be filled
with the glory of God,
as the waters cover the sea.
</section>
<section>
4. All we can do is nothing worth
unless God blesses the deed;
vainly we hope for the harvest-tide
till God gives life to the seed:
</section>
<section>
nearer and nearer draws the time,
the time that shall surely be,
when the earth shall be filled
with the glory of God,
as the waters cover the sea.
