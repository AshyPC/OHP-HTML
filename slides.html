<h3>PP 46: Jerusalem</h3>
1. See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are.
Once these streets had sung to Him;
Now they cry for murder.
</section>
<section>
Such a frail and lonely Man
Holding up the heavy cross -
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us.
</section>
<section>
2. See Him there upon the hill;
Hear the scorn and laughter.
Silent as a lamb He waits,
Praying to the Father.
</section>
<section>
See the King who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down
So that He could save them.
</section>
<section>
3. See Him there upon the cross,
Now no longer breathing.
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus.
</section>
<section>
Feel the earth is shaking now!
See the veil is split in two!
And He stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with His blood.
</section>
<section>
4. See the empty tomb today -
Death could not contain Him!
Once the Servant of the world
Now in vict'ry reigning!
</section>
<section>
Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne!
See Him in the New Jerusalem -
Praise the One who saved us!
