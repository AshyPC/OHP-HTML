<h3>Where Wide Sky Rolls Down</h3>
1. Where wide sky rolls down
and touches red sand,
where sun turns to gold
the grass of the land,
</section>
<section>
let spinifex, mulga
and waterhole tell
their joy in the One
who made everything well.
</section>
<section>
2. Where rain-forest calm
meets reef, tide and storm,
where green things grow lush
and oceans are warm,
</section>
<section>
let every sea-creature
and tropical bird
exult in the light
of the life-giving Word.
</section>
<section>
3. Where red gum and creek
cross hillside and plain,
where cool tree-ferns rise
to welcome the rain,
</section>
<section>
let bushland, farm, mountain-top,
all of their days
delight in the Spirit
who formed them for praise.
</section>
<section>
4. Now, people of faith,
come gather around
with songs to be shared,
for blessings abound!
</section>
<section>
Australians, whatever
your culture or race,
come, lift up your hearts
to the Giver of grace.

<h3>Through the Love of God Our Saviour</h3>
1. Through the love of God our Saviour 
all will be well.
Free and changeless is His favour, 
all, all is well.
</section>
<section>
Precious is the blood that healed us;
perfect is the grace that sealed us;
strong the hand stretched forth to shield us; 
all must be well.
</section>
<section>
2. Though we pass through tribulation, 
all will be well.
Christ has purchased full salvation, 
all, all is well.
</section>
<section>
Happy still in God confiding,
fruitful if in Christ abiding,
holy through the Spirit's guiding; 
all must be well.
</section>
<section>
3. We expect a bright tomorrow; 
all will be well.
Faith can sing through days of sorrow: 
all, all is well.
</section>
<section>
On our Father's love relying,
Jesus every need supplying,
then in living or in dying 
all must be well.

<h3>God Has Spoken By His Prophets</h3>
1. God has spoken by His prophets,
spoken His unchanging Word;
each from age to age proclaiming
God the One, the righteous Lord;
</section>
<section>
in the world's despair and turmoil
one firm anchor still holds fast:
God is King, His throne eternal,
God the first and God the last.
</section>
<section>
2. God has spoken by Christ Jesus,
Christ, the everlasting Son;
brightness of the Father's glory,
with the Father ever one:
</section>
<section>
spoken by the Word incarnate,
God, before all time began,
Light of light, to earth descending,
Man, revealing God to man.
</section>
<section>
3. God is speaking by His Spirit
speaking to the hearts of men;
in the age-long Word expounding
God's own message, now as then.
</section>
<section>
Through the rise and fall of nations
one sure faith is standing fast:
God abides, His Word unchanging,
God the first and God the last.
