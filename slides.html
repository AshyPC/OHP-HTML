<h3>PP 44: Cornerstone (My Hope is Built)</h3>
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
(Repeat)
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.

2. When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
My anchor holds within the veil.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Christ alone, Cornerstone,
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love;
Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.

3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne.
